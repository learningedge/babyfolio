	<p>As you Watch & Play at the next level, you will start to see patterns and signals about who <%= @child.first_name -%> truly is. </p>

	<p>Every child is different and engages with their world in unique ways. Just as an acorn transforms into a mighty oak tree, your baby will give off clues as to who they might be as an adult. Some minds are wired to create symphonies; while others are disposed to build bridges or computers; or to cure medical ailments. Different kinds of minds are destined to lead different adult lives. Just as an acorn holds the blueprint to the mighty oak, even at birth our children give off clues to who they might be as they grow up. </p>

	<p>Imagine if you could better see the big picture about who your child truly is and match opportunities to their interests and needs. You can get to the next level and we can help. </p>
	
	<p>We call this section Reflect because that's exactly what you'll be doing: You'll be thinking about what kind of parent you want to be and how your child's interests and abilities are developing on what you've watched your child do and how you played with your child. What's awesome is you'll start to understand and improve your role and interactions. </p>
	
	<p>Did you know that your interactions and responsiveness support your child's very capacity to think, learn and act in the world?  </p>

	<p>Our Reflect section is designed to help you discover your child's abilities and match the right experiences to help them flourish.</p>
