	<h1>BIG IDEA:</h1>
	<h2 class="icon play">Play</h2>
	<p>Let's focus on our next big idea: Play.  </p>

	<% if @user.profile_media -%>
	 <%= image_tag @user.get_image_src(:profile_medium), { :align => "right", :class => "portrait" } %>
	<% else -%>
	 <%= image_tag WelcomeProgramMailer.get_random_baby_image_src, { :align => "right", :class => "portrait" } -%>
	<% end -%>

	<p>As you strengthen your "Watch" muscles, you will also see more opportunities to join in and enhance <%= @child.replace_forms("#his/her#") %> play and exploration. Imagine if you could provide just the right play at the right time so <%= @child.first_name -%> could better exercise their most important developments and build stronger foundations across <%= @child.replace_forms("#his/her#") %> multiple intelligences? You can get to the next level and we can help! </p>

	<p>Play is how your little one masters their world-- exercising and building their intelligences, skills, knowledge and dispositions. The goal in these early years is to help your child become a <strong>master player</strong>. Encourage them to follow their curiosity to play around, explore, tinker, figure things out, solve problems and create things. And the more you can get down on the floor and muck around with <%= @child.first_name -%> the better. </p>

	<p>Adults make a big difference. Providing a range of experiences and responding to your child's interests, strategies, and feelings will generate enriched play that strengthens your child's unique development.  </p>
	
	<p class="no-spacing">There are three different strategies for enriching your child's experiences during play:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="#">Mirroring and Echoing</a> - Beginning play by recognizing and supporting your child.s actions and interests. Simply mimic what <%= @child.replace_forms("#he/she#") %> does.</li>
	  <li><a href="#">Scaffolding</a> - Extending the play by providing the minimal level of support for your child needs to achieve what <%= @child.replace_forms("#he/she#") %> is attempting and to construct new skills and knowledge. </li>
	  <li><a href="#">Bridging</a> - Introducing new things into the dialogue by presenting new skills and information you think is important, but is still connected to the child's current interests/abilities.</li>
	  </ul>

	<p>Start by simply getting on the floor and mimicking exactly what your child is doing. See if <%= @child.replace_forms("#he/she#") %> notices you. Speculate what effect it is having. Try out this and the other strategies when playing with your child using our suggested activities below.</p>
