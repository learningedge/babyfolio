INSERT INTO `milestones` VALUES (2505,'l_0_1','Making Sounds that Initiate Interactions ','Newborns actively produce expressions that compel caregivers to attend and respond to them.  These cries help to initiate an interaction between parent and child in which it is the baby who cries but it is the adult who makes meaning of the baby’s cry.  Adults perceive infant crying as an expression of some internal state.  Infants cries vary in properties that signal different levels of distress.  Adults complete this signal by adding a wealth of human understanding to a species-specific plea.  Evelyn Thoman and her colleagues (1983) found that by one month infants’ crying helps to establish interactional stability in mother-infant dyads.\n\nEarlier research suggested that newborn sounds included those of distress, such as crying and fussing, and those of non-distress, such as burping and spitting up.  These were referred to as reflexive (crying sounds which average about one second and are produced in a long series which may last five minutes with short pauses and fussing sounds that are shorter, averaging about one half second in duration and are produced only in a short series) and vegetative (divided into sounds relating to activity, such as a grunt or sigh, and sounds relating to the infants\' regulation of air and liquid and produced mainly to prevent obstruction of the airway), respectively (Stark, 1979).  More recently, researchers have argued that this view lacks an appreciation of the baby as a competent communicator.  While the baby’s linguistic repertoire is limited, Lester and Boukydis (1985) show that different infant cries elicit different behaviors and so represent very effective communication signals.  Crying is seen as an interpersonal event (Barr, 1990). The baby is using these sounds to communicate his/her needs.  While crying is an expression of distress, by the end of the first month, babies are capable of expressing non-distress sounds (Barr, 1990).   While over the first month, most of the interaction between caregiver and infant can be characterized as “shared attention and affect”, between 4 and 6 weeks, many babies are able to engage in verbal interaction with a caregiver, capable of producing “ge, ge or yeh, yeh” sounds, real cooing and gooing, in the context of a verbal interaction.  These sounds are part of an integral part of the ebb and flow of a verbal turn-taking sequence between caregiver and baby. \n\n \nThe range of sounds produced by the newborn is somewhat limited due to the size of the newborn head and the arrangement of the vocal tract.  The human newborn head is small and the mouth is almost completely taken up by the tongue, making it difficult for the newborn to form the spaces in the oral cavity that are required to produce adult vowels (Lieberman, Crelin, & Klatt, 1972; Stark, 1979).  However, the rapid growth of babies\' heads and necks means that their range of sounds changes very quickly and, over the coming months, they will be able to produce many more sounds.  Kent (1981) argues that while newborns are anatomically ill-equipped to produce speech, by 4 to 6 weeks this capacity is in place. \n','\"Now that\'s a hunger cry!\": ','Real life examples of Sounds that initiate Interaction- sounds of distress.','Shaun is asleep.  It is a deep sleep.  We know that because his eyelids are not flickering and his breathing is deep and even.  Soon he begins to move a little in his sleep, his eyelids begin to flicker\nand he lets out a little whimper.  His father raises his head from his desk and waits to see if Shaun\nwill wake or not.  Shaun quiets and his father goes back to his task.  If he looks now he will see that Shaun is now in a lighter sleep   he knows that because his eyes are now flickering and his breathing is more shallow.  His arms and legs are moving.  After a few minutes, Shaun begins to move again, his eyes begin to open and he begins to whimper.  His father waits to see if he will go back down.  He has seen that Shaun sometimes gets his hand to his mouth and quiets himself.  But, not this time, his father can see.  Now, Shaun\'s whimpers are getting louder and building up into a good cry.  His\neyes are open and his color is changing to red.  His arms are thrashing about and his cry has now\nbecome full, loud and persistent.  His father goes over and picks him up in his arms.  He already has\ndiscovered that Shaun\'s cry means that he is hungry and only when he is fed will his crying stop.  \nSometimes Shaun cries just because he wants to be held, but this cry, his father can tell, is a hunger\ncry.  \"Time to eat\", he says, as he hugs Shaun and pats him to help him console.   \n\n','Infants communicate different needs through their cries.  Cries convey a message of urgency, as if\nthe baby is saying, \"please do something\".  They may be \"hungry\" cries, \"mad\" cries or \"pain\" cries. \nParents find themselves listening to the features of the baby\'s cry as they try to assess how they will\nrespond.  These are called cry acoustics.  The \"hungry\" cry is rhythmic and repetitive; the \"mad\" or\n\"angry\" cry is also repetitive and rhythmic but is much more intense and lasts longer; the pain \"cry\"\nbegins with a rapid rise which lasts for a long time and is followed by a long silence of 3 to 7\nseconds.  While parents learn to discriminate between their baby\'s different cries and thus are better\nable to respond to their baby\'s needs, crying can affect parents by its presence or absence.  Infant\ncrying varies greatly in cause, frequency and duration.  Temperamental differences in infants are\nresponsible for some variations but for all infants the significance of crying differs with age.  For\nexample, parents of difficult temperament infants describe their cries as more grating, piercing and\nmore aversive.  The parents often feel irritated and angry by these cries. Excessive crying can cause\ndisturbances in the parent child relationship.  The amount of crying can color a parent\'s perception\nof his child: \"He is such an easy baby, he hardly cries at all!\" or \"he is very difficult, he cries all the\ntime\". \n','Over this first month, you will have many opportunities to learn about #first#\'s cries, what #he/she#\nis trying to tell you through them and how to best respond to #his/her# cries, without losing your\nmind!  Some babies cry very little or cry only when they are hungry.  Parents describe these babies\nas contented or happy.  Some babies seem to cry a great deal more than others.  These babies seem\nmore sensitive to stimulation or have a very low threshold for external stimulation and are much\nmore demanding than others. Their crying is often difficult to deal with but at least it is predictable. \n\"He cries only when he is hungry\".  \n\nSome babies are less predictable and are more difficult to deal with because parents find it hard to\ntell why the baby is crying.  There seems to be no consistent pattern and no consistent reason for\ncrying.  Just when you have figured out a way to deal with the crying, it does not work next time\naround.  The baby has some other need and this may require a different kind of consoling technique. \nParents often say about these babies, \"I never know what #he/she# needs.  I can\'t seem to be able\nto read her cues.  I just can\'t understand #him/her#\".   Parents can feel very frustrated if their baby\nis like this.  Other babies, perhaps the majority, fall somewhere in between.   Where does #Nickname# fit\nalong this continuum?   Whichever baby you believe you have, your task is to learn to respond in a\nway that best helps relieve your baby from whatever stress #he/she# is under at this moment. \n\n     Some babies cry only to be held.  They may not be hungry but they may need to be\n     comforted by having close physical contact with you.\n     You may see that #Nickname# can often console #himself/herself#  by using his own hand or\n     thumb and putting it in #his/her# mouth\n     Babies cry for very different reasons and so may need very different consoling strategies to\n     help them calm.  In addition, it is helpful to remember that what works at this age may not\n     work later and what works in one setting may not work in another.  Try to be flexible.  Using\n     a pacifier may be helpful in certain situations but it may not be useful to use it all the time.\n     Many babies try to console themselves using their hand or by placing their fist in their mouth. \n     Be sure to give #Nickname# a chance to try that.  Many babies are born sucking their thumbs and\n     can use it very effectively to calm themselves in the face of stress.\n','Sometimes #Nickname# will be able to calm #him/her#self in the face of stress but more often than not,\nyou will have to be ready to relieve your baby\'s stress.  Then the task is to learn what kind of\nconsoling technique best suits your baby.   You will learn when it is a hunger cry and when #he/she#\njust needs to be held or when #he/she# is cold or when \n\n     Try out different consoling techniques with you baby: some babies will console just to the\n     sound of your voice.  \n     Many babies need to be picked up and held before they can be consoled.  Close physical\n     contact can help ease the baby\'s stress level.  The experience of being contained or held\n     closely can help #Nickname# reduce #his/her# excessive motor activity and so return to a more\n     comfortable position.\n     Some babies console only when they are held and rocked.  They seem to need this rocking\n     motion to help them get back to sleep or to a more comfortable quiet alert state\n     If your baby tends to be active and move around a lot during sleep and so may wake up a lot,\n     try placing a rolled blanket or cover each side of the baby so that #he/she# will have secure\n     boundaries and #his/her# activity level will be reduced.\n     Many babies will sleep better and cry less if you swaddle them when you put them down to\n     sleep.\n     Massaging or caressing can be soothing for all babies but especially for babies who tend to\n     cry a lot\n','Sounds of Distress','Learning to distinguish different cries','You have fed your baby and #he/she seems to set for a long sleep.  But shortly after you have put\n#her/him# down and you have begun to get a relax, #he/she# begins to cry. #he/she# cries softly at\nfirst and just whimpering but then it is becoming louder.\n','\n\nThe response\n\nYou listen to how loud the cry is, whether there is a slow or a quick build up, and how long it lasts.\nYou are moving towards her as you wonder if it is a hunger cry or a pain cry, or if #he/she# needs\nto be changed.  Over time, you will begin to be able to identify #his/her# crying patterns by listening\nto hear how loud it is, if it has a particular pattern, what time of day it is likely to take place, how\nlong it lasts, what works to help #him/her# console, what #his/her# posture is when #he/she# begins\nto cry. \n','Check #him/her# to see what else may have triggered the cry.  Make sure #he/she# is comfortable\nin #his/her# crib.  Allow your baby to tell you what soothing technique #he/she# prefers.  Since every\nbaby is different you must search for the kind of calming technique that works best for your baby. \nIn general, the most effective consoling technique includes s a combination of containment (holding\nor swaddling), touch (massaging or caressing) or rhythmic stimulation (rocking).  Your immediate\ngoal is to stop your baby crying and at times that is all that matters.  When #Nickname# cries, #he/she#\nmay not need to be picked up and rocked immediately.  Try to use your face and voice alone, or even\njust your voice.  Pitch your voice to the same level as #his/hers# and fit your voice into the rhythm\nof #his/her# cries.  If this does not work, then place your hand on #his/her# belly and see if this\nsoothes #her/him#.  For the baby who is very active, containing #her/his# hands also may help\n#her/him# quiet.  If #he/she# continues to cry, then of course pick #him/her# up.  You might also\nrock #him/her# to help #him/her# calm down.  Sometimes #Nickname# will get very upset, in which case,\nyou also may give #him/her# your finger or a pacifier to suck.\n','As #Nickname# grows and develops, and as #his/her# appreciation of #his/her# world expands, the causes\nof #his/her# crying change and become more complex.  ##He/She## may begin to fuss for long\nperiods at the end of each day, which is called colic.  There are things you can do to figure out these\nother causes of your infant\'s crying, and to help #him/her#.\n','Crying is beneficial for #first#.  It communicates #his/her# needs effectively and is a way of getting\nyou to interact with #him/her#.  In this way, crying is social.

Researchers expect that this is because babies have been listening to mothers\' voice while in the womb.  [Link to prenatal development of auditory development].  Sounds outside the amniotic sac can be recorded inside the amniotic sac. (Querle & Renard, 1981, as cited in Sachs, 1989.)  Infants, 3-8 days old, show a preference for the human voice over other sounds. (Hutt et al, 1968)  Researchers wondered if babies may simply became familiar with their mothers\' voices in the first few days following birth (Vasta, Haith, & Miller, 1992).  If so, they reasoned that babies should prefer their fathers\' voices over strange male voices.  However, they found that infants do not prefer their fathers\' voices over other male voices (DeCasper & Prescott, 1984).  Therefore, it seems that it is the prenatal rather than postnatal exposure that contributes to infants\' early recognition and preference for mothers\' voices.  Further evidence that prenatal hearing is linked to familiarity and preference after birth comes from research showing that newborns prefer hearing speech that mothers \"read\" to them prenatally compared to speech mothers had not read to them (DeCasper & Spence, 1986).  Pregnant women were asked to read aloud a story each day in the final 6 weeks of pregnancy.  After birth, the infants showed a clear preference for hearing the familiar story rather than a new story, whether the mother or a stranger read the story.  This shows that is was not just the mother\'s voice they preferred, but that they were familiar with the pattern of the sounds of the story itself.\n\n \nIn addition to showing a preference for their mothers\' voices and a story heard prenatally, infants as early as two days of age prefer a certain type of talk, called \"baby talk\" or \"motherese\" (Cooper & Aslin, 1990).  Motherese is a special intonation pattern, with a musical quality in the higher pitch, more variable (rising and falling) pitch, and exaggerated stress (Sachs, 1989). In addition, motherese is a less complex way of speaking which includes fewer words per utterance and more repetitions. When adults adjust the way they speak to an infant by using motherese, they may be increasing the likelihood that the baby will be listening, attending, and, perhaps, learning (Vasta, Haith, & Miller, 1992).  Research shows that the higher pitch and exaggerated stress of baby talk tends to be used for important words, such as labels for objects; therefore, the child may be more likely to attend to those important words (Fernald & Mazzie, 1991).  Holding the infant\'s attention by using baby talk may also strengthen the emotional bond between parent and child; however, it is important to note that deaf parents and parents in cultures where baby talk is not used also develop emotional bonds with their children (Sachs, 1977).  Research shows that both fathers and mothers use motherese (Papousek, Papousek, & Haekel, 1987), as well as people who are inexperienced with infants (Jacobsen, Boersma, Fields, & Olson, 1983).  Although motherese has been observed in a variety of languages (Drach, 1979; Ferguson, 1964; Kelkar, 1964; Ruke Dravina, 1977), it is not a universal style of speech to infants.  For example, Quiche Mayan families in Guatemala do not use higher pitch in speaking to infants because higher pitch in that culture is a sign of respect and would be socially inappropriate if used with a baby (Bernstein Ratner & Pye, 1984).\n','\"She\'s already talking\"','The sounds of a contented baby\"','Exactly three weeks ago to the day, John and Marie brought their newborn baby, Lucas, home from\nthe hospital.  Each day he seems to be able to stay awake for longer and longer periods. He is\nlooking around and is much more alert than ever before.  They have been talking  to him since the\nday he was born.  When they talk to him, they see that he stares back intently at their faces and every\nday, they think he notices more and more.  To day, Marie, has just fed Lucas and is holding him in\nher arms giving him time to digest his food.  He is bright and alert.  She is talking to him and his eyes\nare entrained on hers.  She begins to tickle him gently on the chin and makes up a little sing song\nrhyme, \"How is Lucas? How is Lucas? Here I am, Here I am\".  Lucas looks at her intently, eyes\nbright and alert.  Suddenly, Lucas begins to coo back to his mother.  It is a slight sound, but Marie\ncontinues her sing song rhyme and gives Lucas a chance to coo back.  For Marie, something\nremarkable has taken place and she and Lucas have moved on to a different level of communication.\n','While, babies can communicate their needs through their cries, they can also tell you when they are\nhappy. #Nickname# communicates #his/her# pleasure through making pleasurable sounds or cooing!  We\nknow that the newborn prefers to look at #his/her# mother\'s face and attend to #his/her# mother\'s\nvoice above all others.  Over these first few weeks, Lucas is learning to recognize the rhythms and\ncadences of his mother\'s voice. And Lucas indeed is gazing at his mother\'s face.  But sometime after\nthree weeks of age, there is a shift in the nature of the baby\'s responses to #his/her# parents,\nparticularly in #his/her# emerging ability to vocalize.  Now #he/she# may begin to coo in response\nto #his/her# parent\'s voice and face, and what is clear is that this is an expression of pleasure.  In this\ncase, Marie\'s response is one of satisfaction and pride.  It is the first mutual reciprocal responsive\nround of interactive conversation, Marie and Lucas have had together.  It is not language, but it is\nclear communication and it places mother and baby on a new level of interaction.\n','During this first month of ##first##\'s life, you have seen that #he/she# is able to see you and can hear\nyour voice and, even more importantly, is trying to get to know and communicate with you. \nLearning your baby\'s language, learning to read his/her communication cues and learning the best\ntimes to play and interact with your new baby becomes your major task at this time.\n\n     #his/her# alert, open expression is an invitation to talk and play! ##He/She## is telling you\n     #he/she# is ready for interaction, since these opportunities do not follow any chronological\n     time table, and for it to work, your response must match the baby s level of readiness.  The\n     times when you play and talk with your baby are at once both exciting and engaging for your\n     baby but at the same time demanding on #his/her# developing behavioral system.  If your\n     response is not in tune with your baby then the whole experience can be overwhelming for\n     the baby and #he/she# will not enjoy it.  \n\n     As you look at and play with your baby, be sure to keep an eye on #his/her# motor\n     behaviors.  If you find #him/her# stiffening or arching away or #he/she# pushing #his/her#\n     feet into your stomach, then you can be sure that whatever you are doing is not right.  It may\n     be a sign of overstimulation.  Even something as subtle as finger splaying can tell you about\n     the level of intensity or effort your baby is putting in to this interaction.\n   \n     #Nickname# probably does recognize your voice so that when #he/she# is quiet and alert, then you\n     can begin to talk with #him/her# and once you find the right tone of voice and the right\n     rhythm, #he/she# will respond.  Watch #his/her# responses closely.  ##He/She## may respond\n     by looking back at you.  As long as #his/her# body remains relaxed and #his/her# color\n     remains good, continue to talk.  If #he/she# begins to fuss or cry, then back away. \n     ##He/She## is telling you that #he/she# is being overstimulated.   \n\n     If during your play with #Nickname# and #he/she# begins to coo in response to you, keep it going\n     in a back and forth rhythmic manner for as long as #Nickname# wants to keep it up.  Be sure, once\n     again, not to overdo it and only keep the interaction going.  This is a precursor of the same\n     turn taking that characterizes communication through language.\n\n     As you talk to and play with your baby, watch #his/her# breathing, #his/her# color changes,\n     and watch out for any tremors or startles.   If your voice or the music or whatever the baby\n     is attending to is too loud or abrupt, the baby may startle and change color or you may see\n     tremors.  These are clear signs that the baby\'s arousal system is being overtaxed.\n\n     Some babies are very sensitive to stimulation.  They like to be held firmly, without much\n     back and forth movement and as you play with them, you will find that it may be better to\n     interact with them, one modality at a time.  Rather than talk and sing for example, just look\n     first, and only when you assess that your baby can tolerate the extra stimulation, then add\n     your voice, softly and almost in a whisper, at first.  Over time, be sure to allow your baby to\n     tell you how much and what kind of stimulation is right for #him/her#.\n    \nWhat you will learn from your baby is that babies have their own language to tell you when they are\nhappy and when they are unhappy, when they are enjoying their play with you and when they need \ntime outs  or need to break the intensity of the interaction.  If you have been out at work and you\ncome in eagerly to look at and play with your baby, remember that your  right  time and your baby\'s\nright  time may not coincide.  Wait until your baby is ready, read #his/her# cues and allow #him/her#\nto tell you when is best time for your face to face play and interaction. Not every baby has the same\nthreshold for stimulation and your task is to find out what your baby\'s is.\n','In the early days after birth, most mothers and fathers are engaged in a continuous patter of talk with\ntheir babies.  They not only hold them, touch them, cuddle them and examine every part of their\nbodies but they are speaking all the time, as if their baby understood everything they say!  You may\nhave found yourself just looking and admiring #first#, while studying #his/her# expressions when\n#he/she# wakes.  You probably ask yourself, \"Who is #he/she# like?\" \"What does #he/she# make\nof everything?\" \"What does #he/she# feel?\" \"Can #he/she# see me?\" \"Can #he/she# hear my voice?\"\n\"What does #he/she# need from me?\"  You have to learn your baby\'s language.  Here is a list of\nbehaviors to look out for, that will tell you when #Nickname#  is ready to communicate with you: \n\n     #his/her# body tone is relaxed (watch #his/her# hands to see if the fingers are straight out or\n     curled and relaxed and see if #his/her# legs are stiff or relaxed), the color is good, #he/she#\n     is not crying and #his/her# eyes are open and have a focussed alert look.  \n     Here is a list of behaviors your baby may show if #he/she# is unhappy and does not want to\n     continue to interact with you: #he/she# fusses or cries, begins to squirm about, looks away,\n     gives off tremors, startles, hiccups, has bowel straining or a bowel movement, grimaces.  \n     Crying is a very clear sign that whatever you are doing is not right for you baby but some of\n     these cues are more subtle and demand you stay attuned to your baby s cues.  \n     Some of these communication cues may pass by so quickly that you hardly notice them but\n     if #his/her# startles when you say something or do something, then this is the only way your\n     baby can tell you to back off or give #him/her# a \"time out\".  \n     As you learn more and more about #Nickname# you will see what times and places #he/she#\n     prefers for this kind of interaction, what way #he/she# likes to be held, what tone of voice\n     #he/she# prefers.

Like adults, they demonstrated categorical perception--the sound \"ba\" is different from the sound \"pa.\" (Eimas, Siqueland, & Jusczyk, 1971)  However, unlike adults, they were able to hear the difference between unfamiliar sounds from different languages (for instance the Czech \"za\" and \"ra\") (Trehub, 1976)!  They were perceptually sensitive to differences in the foreign speech that adults were not.  Beyond this, as they got older, they lost the ability to \"hear\" the differences. As infant\'s abilities to perceive speech is shaped by their native language, the ability to discriminate sounds in foreign languages gradually disappears (Eimas, 1975).  By 10-12 months, children had lost their ability to discriminate sounds in languages they have never heard (Werker & Tess, 1984).  This pattern of early perceptual ability with speech sounds which gradually disappears is also found in children\'s perception of music [Link to music development in 6 mos. olds]   \n\nSeveral studies support the view that categorical perception in not limited to speech.  In one such study, adults demonstrated categorical perception for musical sounds (Cutting & Rosner, 1974, as cited in Aslin, Pisoni, & Jusczyk, 1983).  Discrimination was better for pairs of sounds from different perceptual categories than for those from the same category.  In a study of infant categorical perception of different nonspeech sounds, 2 month olds listened to pairs of sounds differing in rise time (the amount of time is takes for a sound to reach its full intensity).  The infants detected a difference only between sounds that were from different categories of sound rise time.  Therefore, the infants demonstrated categorical perception for nonspeech sounds, similar to adults.\n\nThis is not to imply that infants can distinguish all phonemically relevant stimuli or that speech perception does not develop as children get older. (Trehub, Bull, & Schneider, 1981).  There are certain types of categories and certain placements of contrasting phonemes that infants were not able to discriminate (Eilers & Minifie, 1975) and certain cues (such as vowel durations) (Eilers, 1977) that contributed to their ability to discriminate certain sounds.   Six month old infants exposed to and trained on these contrasts showed improvement (Holmberg, Morgan, & Kuhl, 1977), but by 12 months, so did children who were not trained (Eilers, et al., 1977). \n\nAccording to Vasta, Haith, and Miller (1992), infants seem to have a sensitivity for aspects of sound that are critical for perceiving language.  Newborns can detect differences in how long sounds last (Clifton, Graham, & Hatton, 1968, as cited in Vasta, Haith, & Miller, 1992) as well as differences in sound rise time, which is how long it takes a sound to reach its full intensity (Kearsley, 1973, as cited in Vasta, Haith, & Miller, 1992). The ability to detect differences in rise time is of particular importance for distinguishing speech sounds.  Infants also have a preference for listening to sounds falling with the range of the human voice. Thus, equipped with these abilities and preferences, infants as young as one month of age can perceive differences in speech sounds (Aslin, Pisoni, & Jusczyk, 1983, as cited in Vasta, Haith, & Miller, 1992).\n\nResearchers have found that certain tones are better at soothing infants and in engaging their attention.  For example, Eisenberg (1970, 1976, as cited in Vasta, Haith, & Miller, 1992)) found that infants quieted down when they heard low tones, whereas they were distressed when they heard higher tones.  Infants are also affected by the cries of other infant and, when they hear another infant cry, they are likely to begin crying, too (Sagi & Hoffman, 1976, as cited in Vasta, Haith, & Miller, 1992).\n\n \nYoung infants do not detect loudness the same way as adults do.  Typically, a sound needs to be about 10 20 decibels louder for an infant to hear it (Hecox & Deegan, 1985; Schulman Galambos & Galambos, 1979). This is especially the case with low pitched sounds (Sinnott, Pisoni, & Aslin, 1984).  It takes many years for children\'s hearing to reach its peak sensitivity.  By the time children are twelve or thirteen, they can hear the same decibels as adults do (Sroufe, 1994).  However, this is about the time that sensitivity to hearing peaks  hearing does not simply continue to improve as people get older (Vasta, Haith, & Miller, 1992).  People are most sensitive to higher frequencies even earlier  around 4 or 5 years of age  with no improvement beyond this age (Trehub et al., 1988, as cited in Vasta, Haith, & Miller, 1992).\n\nResponse to noise is individualized even in infants.  Some infants will turn to the sound of a whisper or a low well timed modulated high pitched voice and others turn to the sound of a sing-song repetitive series of sounds or a louder noise.  If the baby is asleep he/she can shut out a loud noise and if he is alert he/she will respond to abrupt loud noises by shooting off a startle and if it is a very sharp sound, physiological stress signs, color change and tremors (Brazelton and Nugent, 1995). \n\nSome language impaired children have difficulty detecting sounds of short duration.  For example, these children have trouble detecting differences in syllables like \"ba\" and \"da\" that start with consonant sounds lasting only tens of milliseconds.  However, research (Science, 1996) shows that certain computer exercises can substantially improve the language abilities of children with this perceptual problem.  Using a computer program, researchers changed the spoken commands of \"Simon Says,\" stretching the speech and making the short consonant sounds louder.  The children involved in this research also played computer games that began at an easy level (long duration and well spaced sounds).  As the children improved, the games got more difficult (shorter duration sounds that were more closely spaced together.  After several weeks of this training, language tests indicated that the children\'s language ability improved.   This improvement remained when the children were tested again six weeks after training ended.  Speech researchers suggest that this finding is remarkable in that the children\'s improved abilities transferred from computer games to normal speech.  Now, researchers are studying whether this type of computer training has a similar impact on children with reading problems and children with dyslexia.\n\n','\"He knows me already!',NULL,'Joyce is sitting watching her new daughter, Siobhan, lying in her crib.

Babies adjust their sucking and pausing patterns to correspond with their parent\'s actions in a kind of early conversation.  Conceptually, this is like the turn-taking that children do later when they are engaged in conversations and realize that one person talks at a time.  [See related Language LW-27-29 Months-#2- Learning to Negotiate Conversations.]  Researchers  (Kaye, 1982; Kaye & Wells, 1980) have studied the patterns of babies\' sucking and their mothers\' gently jiggling them.  They found a subtle type of turn-taking that is well-established from only a few days after birth.  Looking at the pattern in depth, Kenneth Kaye and colleagues found that while the pattern starts with babies\' natural sucking patterns (Wolff, 1966) (what infants would do even if they weren\'t being held and jiggled), mothers respond to this pattern in how and when they jiggle, and that babies increasingly adapt to the patterns.  They didn\'t start as often sucking while being jiggled and they started soon after the jiggling stopped (Kaye, 1982; Kaye & Wells, 1980). At such a tender age, babies were learning to take their turn soon after mothers finished, not during or long after.  Researchers consider these important patterns to be the beginning of social dialogue (Kaye, 1977)!\n\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:29:57','2012-08-22 12:29:57'),(2509,'l_2_1','Cooing and Early Laughter','Around 8-12 weeks (and in some cases, even earlier), babies begin to coo (uttering a vowel like sound such as \"ah\" and \"oo\"), smile, and make eye-contact as they interact with their caregivers (Stark, 1979).  Infants often coo when they are comfortable, usually in response to a parent smiling and talking.  While cooing and smiling usually take place in social settings, research has shown that babies at this age will also make non-cry vocalizations even when there is nobody interacting with them (Wolff, 1987).  The coos are made from the back of the mouth and have a prominent vowel \"oo\" sound.  There are also brief consonant sounds, such as \"g\" or \"k.\"     Parents may even see some laughter at this age.\n\nCoos can also contain elements characteristic of the newborn distress cry, a signal of discomfort which the infant is still unable to inhibit.  Thus, cooing can be a combination of discomfort and pleasure sounds. However, cooing sounds usually are accompanied by smiling or laughter and indicate more positive emotions (Blount, 1982).  The first cooing sounds the infant produces are single segments lasting half a second.  Over time, the infant produces a series of 3 to 10 segments, with either a breath between segments or several segments in one breath.  Later cooing sounds have more varied vowel sounds (Lieberman, Buhr, Keating, Hamby, & Landahl, 1976), although it is difficult to determine which vowel sounds infants are producing (Stark, Heinz, and Wright Wilson, 1976).  Longer series of comfort sounds are referred to as \"early syllabification\" (Zlatin, 1975).  However, these segments are not like adult speech syllables.\n','\"The social smile\" ',' \"First conversations\"','Jenna is lying on her back in her bassinet.

As #he/she# does this, #he/she# first sobers as\n#he/she# tries to match this visual pattern with the image #he/she# already has.

No sooner are you at the door than she begins to cry.  Before you even think, you\nare really angry.   What is wrong with you?\", you say as you pick her up.  Jill has stopped crying. \n Her expression is now sober as she stares at her mother.  Her mother notices her changed\nexpression and immediately hugs her and says, \"I\'m sorry, sweetheart\".  But, it took Julia a long time\nto get Jill back into a happy mood. Had Jill sensed her anger?  Could she understand?, she wonders\nto herself.  Your baby can and will pick up on your emotional responses. #he/she# can distinguish\na happy expression from a sad expression and is in turn affected by that expression.  Babies are\nalready beginning to relate external expressions with internal feelings.  #Nickname# is learning to read and\ndistinguish different emotional expressions.   However, even before the words are out of her mouth,\nJill\'s mother realizes her mistake.  Does her baby sense her negative reaction?  Yes.  How will it\naffect their relationship?   It is only if this response became a consistent pattern that one could say\nthat the baby\'s development would be adversely affected.  It is after all, the very emotional tone of\nthese transactions between baby and caregiver that give the baby #his/her# best view of the world.\nIt is here in the small events of everyday life that your baby learns whether #he/she# is loved and\nvalued or not.  \n\n','Even the most loving parent will occasionally lose #his/her# composure with #his/her# new baby and\nbecome angry.  This is particularly true, when you are tired and sleep deprived.  It is also likely if you\nhave little or no help in looking after your new baby, if you feel alone and without support.  What\nis important is that you learn from the experience.  Now you know, your baby\'s brain has developed\nto the extent that #he/she# can pick up on negative emotions. You see that it caused #him/her#\ndistress.  This knowledge is the beginning of the solution.','You know that babies thrive in an environment that is warm, positive and consistent. You know that\nit is the quality of your interactions with #Nickname# that will promote #his/her# development.  Feelings\nof anger can stand in the way of this development and it is best to address these issues before they\nbecome a pattern and color the way you interact with #first#.  The best way to prevent this\nhappening again is to examine not only the immediate causes of your anger but also to ask yourself\nwhat it is in your life at this time that led you to respond in this way.  Of course, you have to look\nwithin your heart but it is more likely that the solution is to be discovered by looking at the family\nlife style.   Now, you have to rearrange you life to reduce this level of stress and to minimize the\nchances that you this negative tone could begin to characterize your relationship with your child. \nIt may involve a re distribution of family tasks, a re definition of family roles, a re evaluation of job\nresponsibilities.  This is a family issue, something you and your partner or significant other must\ndiscuss together. For the next few months, #Nickname# will like nothing else than to be able to look into\nyour eyes and play with you.  This is such a wonderful time to learn how to communicate with your\nbaby and to learn about #him/her#.  \n',' As you talk to and play with your baby, you will see that #he/she# is able to recognize the sequences\nand patterns of your speech.  Even at this stage, babies seem to pick up on the different interaction\npatterns of fathers and mothers and have different expectations for each.  Fathers tend to be more\nphysical in their play with their babies and babies in turn learn to expect this.  But by now, you see\nclearly by observing #first#\'s responses when you talk and play with #him/her# that, #Nickname# is really\nenjoying these moments.  #his/her# smiles and coos are becoming more predictable.  #he/she# can\nnow pick up on the emotional tone of your exchanges with #him/her#.   #Nickname# can distinguish happy\nfrom sad expressions. Babies are already beginning to relate external expressions with internal\nfeelings.  #Nickname# is learning to read and distinguish different emotional expressions.  Babies at this\nage seem to be able to detect changes in the emotional tone of the interaction. Caught up in the\ninteraction, the baby shares in and is affected by the emotional experience of the adult caregiver.  We\nnow know that the very quality of these interactions are contributing to your baby\'s brain\ndevelopment, that they are the foundations for language development and that the emotional tone\nof these encounters between #Nickname# and you are shaping #his/her# future social and emotional\ndevelopment. \n','\nEven in this early stage of language development, it is important to respect your baby\'s own style\nor temperament and how #he/she# takes in information.  From a baby\'s point of view, what they\nwant above all, is to have us accept and respect their own individual temperament, their own unique\nway of managing things.  Of course, we can only learn that by watching #Nickname# respond to different\nsituations and different people.  The opportunity to grow and develop to their full potential depends\nto a great extent on our ability as parents to accept and respect our own baby\'s individuality,\n#his/her# own disposition and personality.  This means making every effort to provide a warm, safe\nenvironment for #Nickname# that gives #him/her# all the security #he/she# needs to grow and an\nappropriately stimulating environment that will enable #him/her# to develop and thrive.   One of the\nkey elements in this challenge if for parents to learn as much as they can about their baby\'s\ntemperament and see what kind of environment #he/she# seems to thrive on.   Matching your input\nto your baby\'s needs, making sure that whatever stimulation you offer #Nickname# does not overwhelm\n#his/her# system, arranging an environment that ensures that your baby can develop good sleep\npatterns, matching the way you talk with and play with your baby, will all contribute to your baby\'s\ndevelopment, because they are in harmony with #first#\'s temperamental style.    \n\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:29:57','2012-08-22 12:29:57'),(2510,'l_2_2','Learning to Reciprocate by Gaze Coupling and Smiling','Around 10 weeks of age, parents will notice early social exchanges that are the beginnings of turn-taking and later conversational skills.  Children smile and respond to human face, toys, and other pleasurable events.  In fact, two month old infants make a fundamental distinction between people and objects (Brazelton et al. 1974).  Prereaching infants presented with an object look intently at it, sit up straight, remain relatively still and punctuate their fixed gaze with swiping movements and brief glances away.  Presented with people, infants’ posture is more relaxed and their movements are smoother.  Above all, infants give full greeting responses to people but not to objects.  In a word, infants communicate with people and act instrumentally on objects at this age (Tronick, 1989). They are smiling in recognition (Piaget, 1952/1963; Zelazo, 1972) and in response to stimulation and their smile invites continued response from others.  Wolff (1963) in his classic study of smiling, described how when newborn infants are in a quiet, alert state, looking at them and gently talking to them can produce a smile.  He described how the infant’s smile is first regularly elicited by a vocalization and then by a face.  Also, researchers have studied what they call \"gaze-coupling\" with three month olds and their mothers (Jaffe, Stern & Perry , 1973).  Gaze-coupling is an early form of communicative behavior where caregivers and infants look into each other\'s eyes.  This looking takes on a pattern of a \"conversation\" as the caregiver and infant alternately gaze and look away.   Over time, these early reciprocal acts will develop into the more sophisticated social and communicative exchanges of face to face play and \"conversations\" that emerge in the  third and fourth month.  \n\nResearcher indicates that the influence of the adult and infant changes as the infant develops.  However, there is no agreement on the exact pattern of this change.  Some researchers suggest that mothers and infants at three months and nine months of age are just as likely to influence the flow of the interaction, whereas infants six months of age are more likely to take charge (Cohn & Tronick, 1988b).  Other researchers suggest that mutual gaze is increasingly more balanced, with a shift from the infant merely responding to their caregiver to the infant being part of a two way interaction (Kaye & Fogel, 1980).  Researchers also note that the lack of coordination in these interactions may be an important part of development.  While there does seem to be an increase from the third to ninth month in the coordination of mutual gaze, mismatching frequently occurs.  It may be that during these \"negotiations,\" the infant learns what works and what doesn\'t work in developing shared attention (Golinkoff & Gordon, 1988, as cited in Adamson & Bakeman, 1991).\n\nAre infants aware of the emotional meaning in the caregiver\'s facial expression?  Researchers asked mothers to remain \"still faced\" when they looked at their infant ( (e.g. Tronick, 1980; Tronick, Cohn & Shea, 1986; Tronick, Als, & Brazelton, 1980.  The mothers did not change their expression.  In response to this \"still faced\" expression, infants as young as 2 months of age become less positive emotionally.

As he picks him up, he notices that Billy does not smile at him but seems to be\nlooking at him quizzically.  Joe says \"H I I I I\" and waits.  The baby\'s expression is still sober.  He\nis looking straight at his Dad\'s face and he seems to be listening intently to his father.  \"H  I I I I\"\nsaid Joe\".  Still no smile.  \"Did you forget me?  It\'s Dad\", said Joe, picking him up and smiling\nbroadly all the while.  Suddenly, Billy began to grin.  Then the grin turns into a broad smile.   \"H I I I I\", says his father, drawing out the sound.  Now Billy\'s eyes are bright alert and he begins to coo. \nHis Dad coos back and they both begin to coo to each other, one following the other, moving in\nsynchrony as in a dance   back and forth, taking turns, each waiting for the other to respond.  After\na while, Joe notices that Billy is not looking at him any more but seems to be looking across his\nshoulder into the distance.  He puts him on his shoulder and gently pats his back. \n','By the third month, a model of the face is emerging in Billy\'s developing brain.  When Billy sees his\nDad\'s face, he has to compare or matches this experience with the internal model of a face he already\nhas.  That is why Billy does not smile immediately at his Dad.  His face is sober as he seems to be\ntrying to match this face with the image he already has.  It is as if he is saying to himself, \"I know\nthat voice and I recognize the rise and fall, of the speech patterns.  Nobody says \"Hi I I I\" quite like\nthat.  Let me see, who can it be?\".  The cognitive effort #he/she# puts into this problem solving\nchallenge is the source of the tension in Billy\'s face.  Then comes the smile.  It is a smile of\nrecognition, as he successfully matches the new face with the old internal image.  He smiles and coos\nat his father.  As they coo back and forth, Billy is also learning about turn taking, the basic rules\nabout the give and take of interaction and conversations.  He is learning that each conversation has\na beginning and an end and that each participant must wait for the other to know how best to\nrespond.   Perhaps, most of all, he is enjoying this game with his father.  In fact, as you watch the\nquality of his smiles and coos, Billy seems to be telling us that there is nothing in life he enjoys more\nthan this. \n',' As you play with #Nickname# you will soon discover that favorite phrases or games sequence that\n     #he/she# prefers and that seem to produce a happy mutually satisfying response, e.g. \"I\'m\n     gonna get you\" games. \n\n     Bath time, diapering, feeding time all present wonderful opportunities to play with your baby\n     and try out these sequences and games. With repetition a baby learns the sounds and sights\n     associated with a game sequence and must be allowed the time to become accustomed to\n     this. \n     If your baby is sleepy or drowsy, it is better to respect #his/her# need for sleep than to try\n     to arouse #him/her# and play games with #him/her#.   Your best time for \"quality play\" may\n     not be your baby\'s best time.  Parents coming in from work may feel a passionate desire to\n     pick up and play with their baby.  You missed #him/her# so much during the day that you\n     cannot wait to talk with #him/her# and see those new smiles.  However, it is more important\n     to see if in fact this is what your baby wants at this time.\n\n     As you talk and play with you baby, you will surely overstimulate #him/her#. #he/she# may\n     be quite upset.  This is normal.  Not every parent child interaction with be in perfect\n     synchrony like a ritual mating dance.  Developing \"good\" satisfying interfactional patterns\n     with #Nickname# will take time and will involve many mistakes, but recognizing and avoiding\n     these mistakes next time is the best way to help your baby learn how to communicate.\n','The more you play with #Nickname# the more convinced you will be that #he/she# is able to recognize\nthe sequences and patterns of your speech.  But more than that, #Nickname# is really enjoying these\nmoments.  #he/she# smiles and coos every time.  #he/she# can now pick up on the emotional tone\nof your exchanges with #him/her#.   #Nickname# can distinguish happy from sad expressions. Babies are\nalready beginning to relate external expressions with internal feelings.  #Nickname# is learning to read and\ndistinguish different emotional expressions.  Babies at this age seem to be able to detect changes in\nthe emotional tone of the interaction.  Babies are learning that a sad face means the person is sad,\na joyful expression means the person is happy and an angry face means that the bearer of that angry\nexpression is angry or at least is not happy.  Caught up in the interaction, the baby shares in and is\naffected by the emotional experience of the adult caregiver.  It may be because adults tend to\nexaggerate their emotional expressions as they play with their babies.  Expressions of joy are\nexaggerated.  Adult partners in their interactions with babies,  spontaneously open their eyes widely,\ntheir eyebrows go up, the mouth opens wide, the head is raised and tilted up slightly and then the\nadult produces a steady stream of exaggerated elongated words.  These actions tend to be repeated\nby parents time and time again so that the baby soon learn not only to perceive details in the adult\'s\nvocal and visual expressions but also experience the intentions of the adult caregiver and the\nemotional intentions of the adult.  With this new level of sophistication, the baby is learning in a very\npoignant way that it is in the quality of the adult response to #him/her# that the infant learns that the\nworld is a loving safe place or one that is uncaring and unresponsive to #his/her# needs. \n\n     You may have to make many efforts before you find the conversational games that both you\n     and your baby enjoy.  That is the excitement of this period.  Every \"conversation\" or play\n     opportunity will be different as you try to find the kind of interaction that works best for both\n     of you.  Again, be sure to let #Nickname# tell you and monitor #his/her# reactions to your games. \n     Many parents play around with different games and songs and stay with them until the baby\n     \"tells\" them it is time to \"change the program\"!\n\n     At this time, your baby is trying to develop a reliable sleep cycle.  If #he/she# wakes up at\n     night, it may not be a good idea to \"jazz #him/her# up\" with stimulating games. This could\n     interfere with #first#\'s efforts to develop good sleep patterns and even though you don\'t\n     intend it, it could make it all the more difficult for #Nickname# to sleep through the night.\n\n     Don\'t worry if you make mistakes   you may upset your baby or you may make him cry but\n     this will happen as you look for the groove that is best suited to your play interactions. \n     Developing a warm mutually satisfying relationship with #Nickname# means learning from our\n     mistakes.  Allow #Nickname# to teach you how #he/she# wants to be responded to #him/her#\n\n     Fathers and mothers have very different styles of interaction with or playing with their babies. \n     There is no typical or right way.  Each parent must look for what is right and comfortable\n     for them.  But always remember, it is #Nickname# who will give you the best guidance as to how\n     to proceed.   It is #Nickname# who \"tells\" you the level and pace of play that best suits #his/her#\n     needs.\n','Learning to take turns','Silly things adults tend to do when they play with\ntheir three month old infants\n','Jonathan himself was an only child and had never really handled a baby until his baby son, Danny, \nwas born.  Like many men, he was excited, but he was anxious and tentative with his new baby.  He\nis not confident of himself as a father and still finds himself quite tense when he picks Danny up to\nplay with him.  Still he loves his son and Jonathan is determined to learn.  As he sits down to play\nwith Danny, he talks to him. \"Hi, Danny!  Did you have a good day?\". \n','Jonathan is surprised to find that Danny becomes quite rigid in his arms.  He tries to settle him more\ncomfortably.  It is as if Danny picks up on his own anxiety.  Still when he says, \"Tell me about your\nday, Danny?\", Danny grins and smiles briefly.  \"How do I get him to smile?\", Jonathan asks himself. \nAfter a while, Danny begins to look around and wriggle.  He is no longer contented.  Jonathan does\nnot know what to do.  What he does know is that this is very different from when Danny is playing\nwith his mother.  He smiles and gurgles much more when his mother plays with him. He is becoming\ndiscouraged.\n','Some people seem to have no trouble learning to play with and communicate with their babies. \n\"He\'s a natural\", they may say about a father as they see him play with his baby.  But, for many\npeople, people like Jonathan, learning to communicate with your baby is a challenge.  There are\nreally no standard rules since ever baby is different and ever parent baby pair is different.  Still, we\ncan say that talking with your baby is not the same as talking to another adult.  Usually, a baby at\nthis age will not respond to a standard adult conversational  monotone.  Everything you say or do\nmust be much more animated.  If you feel as tense as Jonathan, the first step is to observe your\nbaby\'s response closely every time you say something or try something new.   It is after all play.  If\nyou let yourself go, you will allow your voice to cascade an octave and you will find that drawing\nout your syllables seems to capture your baby\'s attention. \"oooooooh\" or \"aaaaaaah\". You may find\nyourself contorting your face to get your baby\'s attention   widening your eyes, opening your mouth\nwide, as you exaggerate all your expressions.   It is like a caricature of adult speech.  At the same\ntime, every expression you offer will only work if #Nickname# responds to it positively.  Every parent and\nchild has to find their own unique rhythm, their own mode of communication.  You will have to find\na tone and a style that suits both you and your baby and allows you to be in synchrony with each\nother. \n','Every day, you can see that #Nickname# is becoming more social.  Don\'t you feel that you are getting to\nknow #him/her# more as a person, as you and #he/she# interact with each other.  #his/her# capacity\nto join in and take part in two way conversational games is increasing by the day.  This two way\ninteraction will continue to expand.   Coos will turn into grins and grins into broad smiles and smiles\ninto belly laughs. #Nickname# will be able to discriminate between sounds, will be able to identify your\npeculiar verbal and behavioral patterns.  Your conversations with your baby will have their own\nsignature and this in turn is evidence of the uniqueness of your relationship with each other.

These infant parent interactions have been shown to support a child\'s developing language capacity and to encourage verbal responsiveness on behalf of the child.  Infants also tend to respond to strangers but with a less excited response.  Some researchers (Roe, McClure, & Roe, 1982) have even found a correlation between children\'s responses as 3 month olds to verbal stimulation and their language scores at age 12!  Research by Catherine Snow (1977) shows that parents reacted to whatever their child did, vocal or not, and incorporated it into the conversation.   Research by Cohn and Tronick (1987) demonstrated that face-to-face interactions between infants and adults as young as three months are bidirectional rather than just being the product of adult skills.  That is, infants modify their affective displays and behaviors on the basis of their appreciation of their mothers’ affective displays and behaviors.  Many of the parents\' communications were attempts to elicit a response from the infant.  At 3 months, parents were willing to accept any response as a part of the \"conversation.\"  As children grew older, parents shifted their expectations.  For instance, by 7 months, parents responded to higher level vocalizations.  By 12 months of age, parents attempted to interpret the vocalizations as words.  These infant-parent interactions have been shown to support a child\'s developing language capacity and to encourage verbal responsiveness on behalf of the child.  Research shows that when mothers vocalized to infants, the highest probability of behavior to occur in the next ten seconds was a vocalization from the infant.(Lewis & Freedle, 1973)  With older children (9 to 18 months), researchers found a high level of verbal stimulation highly correlated with the child\'s linguistic competence.

In a study of infant cry and non cry vocalizations (D\'Odorico, 1984), infants 16 weeks of age demonstrated three distinct vocalizations.  These are discomfort sounds, call sounds, and request sounds.  The infants produced discomfort sounds, such as cries, whimpers, and moans, when they lost interest in a toy or became frustrated.  Call sounds included all cries that occurred when the infants were left alone and began to look for their mother.  Request sounds included non cry vocalizations when the infants were looking for their mother.  Requests were found to be the shortest sequences, calls were a little longer, and discomfort sounds were the longest sequences.  These vocalizations also had different melodic patterns.  Discomfort sounds had falling melodic patterns, whereas call cries and request vocalizations had a rising melodic pattern.  D\'Odorico (1984) suggests that these melodic patterns are the earliest linguistic form and they are demonstrated not only in the infant\'s vocalizations, but also earlier in the infant\'s cries.  For example, the rising melodic patterns found in call cries and request vocalizations are characteristic of the rising intonation used in questions.\n\nWolff (1969) identified three different cry types based on the sound pattern of their cries: 1. A basic or “hunger” cry, which is rhythmic and repetitive and while it starts with a whimper it becomes louder and more sustained, 2. A “mad” or angry cry that is also rhythmic but more intense and 3. A “pain” cry that begins with a long shriek followed by 3-7 seconds of silence, as the baby takes a deep breadth and then becomes more vigorous.   Wolff (1969) discovered that, at the sound of a pain cry, mothers came running to see what was wrong with the baby.   Mothers responded much more slowly to either “hunger” or “anger” cries\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:29:57','2012-08-22 12:29:57'),(2513,'l_4_1','Vocal Play and Early Babbling','Between 16 and 30 weeks of age, babies begin to make single syllable sounds that have either a long consonant or vowel sound.  This vocal play (Stark, 1979) or early form of babbling is viewed as a transition step between cooing and the emergence of true babbling. (See Sachs, 1989 for a discussion).  These sounds are longer in duration than earlier comfort sounds (Stark, 1979).  However, the infant\'s sounds at this stage are not yet the mature syllables of adult speech (Oller & Eilers, 1988). These changes are believed to stem from growth in the physical structures that enable children to make sounds.  While early sound production is constrained by respiratory patterns and by the anatomy of the oral cavity, these physical constraints influence early articulation regardless of the language community.  For example, as the facial skeleton grows, the size of the oral cavity increases, providing more room for the tongue to move around. This means that infants’ earliest language schemes combine front (labial) consonants with back vowels: that is /p/ or /d/ with /m/ or /a/.   Cross-cultural studies have shown that the most likely sound combinations infants produce are /pa/, /da/ and /ma/ and indeed /pa/-like, /da/-like and /ma/-like sound combinations are used as terms for parents in an unusually large proportion of human communities.  It is as if parents have adopted as generic labels for themselves their own infants’ earliest anatomically-determined vocal productions (Laver, 1980).   However, many researchers have shown that the infant’s environment and the quality of the linguistic environment exercises a profound influence over early vocalizations (Papousek et al. 1985). This vocal play has been called \"marginal babbling\" (Oller, 1976) and as a transition step between cooing and babbling.  Researchers suggest that this vocal play enables the infant to explore the vocal area and get information about the rapidly changing spaces in the vocal tract (Stark, 1979).

They are better at hearing and responding to high-pitched sounds than low pitched ones (Kearsley, 1973).  This enhanced perception of and preference for high pitched sounds fits with the way adults speak to infants, which is referred to as \"motherese.\" Motherese is a special intonation pattern, with a musical quality in the higher pitch, more variable (rising and falling) pitch, and exaggerated stress (Sachs, 1989).  Although motherese has been observed in a variety of languages (Drach, 1979; Ferguson, 1964; Kelkar, 1964; Ruke Dravina, 1977), it is not a universal style of speech to infants.  For example, Quiche Mayan families in Guatemala do not use higher pitch in speaking to infants because higher pitch in that culture is a sign of respect and would be socially inappropriate if used with a baby (Bernstein Ratner & Pye, 1984). Stern and his colleagues (1983) showed that adults may be more prone to exaggerating the prosody of their speech to a three or four-month older than a newborn or a toddler because the baby at this age may be the most likely of the three to be amused by such affectively rich vocalizations. \n\nHow do researchers know that babies prefer baby talk?  Anne Fernald gave four month old babies an opportunity to turn his or her head towards a tape with a female voice talking with baby talk or without it.  Babies preferred to turn towards the voice using baby talk (Fernald, 1985).  Some research showed that even two month olds paid more attention to a female voice with a rising intonation (Sullivan & Horowitz, 1983).  Other research shows that even infants 2 days of age prefer motherese (Cooper & Aslin, 1990).\n\nWhy do infants prefer higher pitched sounds?  Fernald and Kuhl (1987) suggest that higher pitch communicates positive emotions.  They cite evidence that higher pitch is associated with a higher degree of emotion (Scherer, 1986, as cited in Fernald & Kuhl, 1987).  It may be that infants prefer motherese due to its emotional expressiveness, especially in the early months when infants do not understand adult speech.  It also may be the pitch range that interests the infants.  Infants respond more to sounds and sights that involve contrast and change (Eisenberg, 1976, as cited in Fernald & Kuhl, 1987).  Marshall Haith (1980, as cited in Fernald & Kuhl, 1987), a developmental psychologist who studies infant vision, proposes that when infants scan objects that have a lot of contrasting features, they are activating neurons in their visual system.  Fernald and Kuhl (1987) suggest that the same process may occur when infants hear sounds that have a range of pitch.  Motherese may activate neurons in the infant\'s auditory system.\n','Pitch & Vocal Imitation',NULL,'Jenny is now able to sit propped up in her infant seat.  Her grandmother is filling the kettle.

Infants as young as four to five months of age already demonstrate sensitivity to the kinds of acoustic signals that identify a clausal unit (Hirsch-Pasek & Golinkoff, 1993).  It\'s possible that the kinds of acoustic signals that are part of \"motherese\" help infants learn the structure of speech.  Motherese is almost musical and stresses intonational features more than other types of speech.  At the end of a clause, there tends to be a pause, a shift in pitch, and a vocal stress (Bonniwell Haslett, 1997).  \n\nChildren\'s understanding of the structure of speech continues to grow in the coming months. By the time infants are 11 months old, they become sensitive to the segmental cues for word units (Bonniwell Haslett, 1997) and by the time they are 13-15 months, they are noticing phrase structure and how words are meaningfully sequenced (Golinkoff & Hirsch-Pasek, 1995).\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:29:57','2012-08-22 12:29:57'),(2516,'l_5_2','Babbling with Recognizable Repeating Sounds ','Around 25-50 weeks old, infants\' babbling begins to contain recognizable sounds.  These sounds have a repeated pattern, a series of consonant vowel syllables, such as ma-ma-ma, da-da-da, or  ba-ba-ba.  While parents get excited when they hear what sounds like mama and dada, typically children don\'t use these sounds as words to name familiar people until they are about 9 months old (Bonniwell Haslett, 1997). These are the sounds that most people identify with babbling.  Frequently, the series begins with a brief vowel, such as abababa (Stark, 1979).   Linguists call it reduplicated babbling because of the repetitious pattern of sounds.  It is also referred to as canonical babbling.  Babies make these sounds when they are alone, too.  In fact they tend to babble more when they are alone (Nakazima, 1975; Stark, 1981).  In reduplicated or canonical babbling, the duration of syllable sounds and consonant vowel transitions are similar to that of adult speech (Stark, 1979).  This is a critical stage, a time when infants begin to produce the mature sounds that can be identified as syllables.  These sounds then serve as the building blocks of words (Oller & Eilers, 1988).  In fact, infants\' first words, such as \"mommy\" and \"daddy\" are often made up of the same sounds infants produce in their reduplicated babbling.  Infants are now gaining more and more control of the physical structures that allow them to make sounds.  Reduplicated babbling does not necessarily have a communicative intent though parents\' interpretation of it as meaningful helps it to become so.  Infants at this stage also begin to use gestures, such as reaching and pointing, to communicate.\n\nResearchers used to believe that children babbled all of the possible sounds that they could make and then depending upon the language spoken, certain sounds were reinforced and the child began to limit their speech production to that.(Mowrer, 1954; Winitz, 1969).  More recent research suggests that this view is overly simplified.  Instead, there are overall developmental patterns that children universally go through.  These appear to reflect the growth of the physical structures that enable children to make certain sounds.  For example, \"b\" and \"g\" are often learned early whereas sounds that require more control such as \"s\" and \"f\" are learned later. (See Sachs, 1989, for an excellent discussion).  Kaye (1982) found that there were periods when maternal and infant actions clearly overlapped as well as periods when they clearly alternated.  For instance, a mother may nod her head and smile as her infant vocalizes (backchanneling), or she might mirror the vocalization in an attempt to prolong it (an example of chorusing).  In either case, smooth communication can involve the co-occurrence or synchrony of behavior rather than turn-taking alternations.\n\nAre there risk factors that might delay when an infant begins reduplicated babbling?  Researchers conducted a long term study in which they observed infants who were either full term (born very close to their due date) or premature (born 3 to 11 weeks early) (Oller, Eilers, Steffens, Lynch, & Urbano, 1994).  Early in the first year, the premature infants showed less mature patterns of vocalizing than the full term infants.  However, they were not generally delayed in producing well formed syllables.  The researchers also compared infants from middle and low socioeconomic status (SES) and found no differences in the rate of speech like sounds.  These results support the view that there are biological foundations of speech.  If an infant is born early or into an environment where there are fewer supports for language development, the vocal system adapts and develops on schedule.  However, the researchers note that, although there are striking similarities in the rate of well formed speech sounds between full term and pre term infants and between middle  and low SES infants, premature infants tended to produce well formed sounds less consistently than full term infants once reduplicated babbling was established.  Also, low SES infants tended to vocalize less in general than middle SES infants.  The researchers suggest that the development of speech reflects both biological and environmental factors.\n','MaMaMaMa','Real Examples of Babbling with Recognizable Repeating Sounds','Mary Anne is sitting on the rug, \"talking\" to herself as she plays with her soft toy.

Caregivers join the infant in exploring by labelling objects during playtime or while reading picture books.  Research indicates that, early in the language development period, children whose mothers jointly explore objects and provide labels develop their vocabularies faster (Smith, Adamson, & Bakeman, 1988).  However, this does not mean that parents should label everything a child sees.  Michael Tomasello and colleagues (Tomasello, 1988; Tomasello & Farrar, 1986) caution against trying to direct the child\'s attention, suggesting that children are most likely to learn words if the caregiver provides labels in response to what interests the child.\n\nIn the absence of language, infants are learning to communicate in novel ways to get what they want.  Although infants can now babble, they cannot yet ask for what they want nor can they point and while most six month olds become very interested in exploring their surrounding environments, but they do not yet have the mobility nor the linguistic competence to get an object they may want.  Infants begin to cluster smiles or cries in combination with directed gaze and vocalizations to engage the caregiver to attend to the object (Adamson & Bakeman, 1983).  There is at this stage “a leap to intersubjective relatedness”, as Stern (1985) points out and while up to now, babies are more likely to babble when the caregiver is speaking, now they may become silent when the other person is talking and may respond with a vocalization when the other person stops talking (Rosenthal, 1982).\n','Toy Talk','Konnor is interested in visually and manually exploring his stacking ring toy.','Konnor is just beginning to sit up, and he clearly prefers this new vantage point to explore his\nsurroundings (instead of lying flat on his back or stomach).  His father, Jack, has learned that he can\nput a few firm cushions on the floor at right angles to one another, and Konnor can use them to stay\nsitting upright.  Alternatively, Konnor enjoys sitting between his father\'s extended legs on the floor,\nwhere he can use his hands to help keep his balance.  One of Konnor\'s favorite toys is a stuffed \nseries of rings that are made of brightly colored cloth.  Jack puts the toy in front of Konnor who\ndelights in taking off each ring.  As Konnor removes the first ring, Jack praises his efforts \"Good job\nKonnor, you took the red ring off the top!\".  Konnor explores the ring by passing it from his left\nhand to his right, and examines it from many angles. \n','Konnor is developing the muscular control to sit on his own, which gives him a new perspective on\nhis environment.  Now he can look at things from above as well as from below (on the floor he had\nto look up at things above the ground level).  This new control over his arms and trunk allows him\nto explore his toys more fully.  His father uses this opportunity to not only build Konnor\'s self\nesteem by praising his attempts and successes at dismantling the toy, but also uses simple language\nto describe to Konnor what he has accomplished.  \n','Konnor may begin to associate different words with different objects: \"red\" with the smallest ring,\nand \"blue\" with the largest ring.

Infants now begin to use cries to communicate to caregivers about objects  (Lester, 1985).  Gustafson and Green (1991) showed that although simple cries (those occurring without looks and gestures) are still present, by 6 months infants are coupling their cries with looks to the caregiver.  By twelve months, many infants will produce elaborate cries that co-occur with object focused gestures such as pointing or with caregiver-directed reaches and tugs.  Through cries, babbling, vocalizations and grunts, smiles, coos and body movements, infants are learning to share their own subjective experience of objects with other people (Stern, 1985).  They are learning to attend simultaneously with a person and a shared object, although this will take several months to master.','Justine coordinates gestures to indicate her needs.',NULL,'Justine is now more receptive to social interactions (and games).

(Golinkoff & Hirsh-Pasek, 1987).  \n\nChildren\'s understanding tends to go from context-bound to context-free (Huttenlocher, 1974) --understanding in situations where the word refers to something that is present versus understanding references to objects that are not present.  Children tend to understand action words early (Benedict, 1976; Huttenlocher, 1974; Nelson, 1973) but the words they produce tend to be object words (shoe, dog, toy).  Benedict (1976) outlined 4 stages that children go through in achieving understanding: 1) the ability to respond to a few terms in particular game-like contexts (peekaboo, patty-cake, thank-you); 2) the ability to respond to a number of words that aren\'t necessarily spoken in context; 3) the ability to respond to more than one word in a sentence.

This is a very difficult question to answer because infants engage in a variety of activities that communicate clearly and successfully from very early ages.  Tronick (1981) reviews the question and provides evidence for communicative intent in the early months of life.  Infants organize their behaviors in relation to their caregivers in the first 3 months of life (e.g. Wolff, 1966) and by two months, are beginning to engage in a reciprocal communicative interaction with caregivers (e.g. Tronick, 1980; Stern, 1977).  However, many researchers agree that around 7 to 8 months of age, there is a change in the level of intentionality with which infants initiate and seek out communication (e.g. Bruner, 1975; Bates et al., 1977; Sander, 1969 as cited in Tronick 1981; Sroufe, 1989).  According to Tronick (1981), in the earlier research, the communication centered around reference to an object and persisted until the person being communicated to acted on the object.  Later research focuses more on the infant\'s sense of self, goal-directed behaviors, and how these impact communicative attempts.  Sroufe (1989) defines the period of time from 6 to 9 months as a phase of \"initiative\".   Babies engage in goal-directed behaviors and some of these are aimed towards caregivers in a communicative sense.  The emergence of instrumental gesturing [See Related Language LW- 9 Months- Emergence of Communicative Gestures: Instrumental Gesturing] can be viewed as a form of such a goal directed communicative intent.','Katie looks towards her walking accessories when hearing the word \n\"walk\".\n',NULL,'Katie\'s mother Carrie notices that when she says \"let\'s go for a walk\".

Now, instead of repeating the same consonant-vowel-consonant sounds (ba-ba-ba), the combination of sounds that the child utters may be different from one syllable to the next.  For example, children might say \"abi\" or \"adaba\" or longer strings like \"abidaba.\"  This is called non reduplicated babbling (Stark, 1979).  This ability shows that children are learning to control the physical structures in their mouths to a greater extent.  Children also begin to use new consonant sounds (such as \"s\" and \"x\") which require more control and skill, as well as new vowel sounds which require sufficient space in the oral cavity, space which may not be available until the second half of the first year (Stark, 1979).  This research shows that there are universal developmental patterns in children that may reflect the growth of the physical structures that enable children to make certain sounds.  Children gradually develop various stress and intonation patterns.  Their nonreduplicated babbling begins to sound so much like a foreign language that researchers label this type of babbling as \"expressive jargon\" (Gesell & Thompson, 1934).  While some infants use expressive jargon for several months, other infants quickly move on to the next stage  first words (Stark, 1979). [See Related Language LW- 10-11 Months-Expressive Jargon]\n\nResearchers used to believe that children babbled all of the possible sounds that they could make and then depending upon the language spoken, certain sounds were reinforced and the child began to limit their speech production to that.(Mowrer, 1954; Winitz, 1969).  More recent research suggests that this view is overly simplified.  Instead, there are overall developmental patterns that children universally go through.  These appear to reflect the growth of the physical structures that enable children to make certain sounds.  For example, \"b\" and \"g\" are often learned early whereas sounds that require more control such as \"s\" and \"f\" are learned later. (See Sachs, 1989, for an excellent discussion).  Studies of the prosody of babbling reveals that although specific sounds produced by different infants seem remarkably similar, it is possible that the speech envelope in which they are placed may be shaped differently in different environments (Locke, 1983).  Recent research runs counter to the universal theory and  suggests that the combination of phonemes in babbling may be limited and that only some syllables are common in babbling (Oller and Eilers, 1992).  In other words, the initial set of words is gradually expanded as the child adds more sounds to the basic repertoire.   This expansion is guided by several complementary mechanisms, including maturation (Locke, 1983), active exploration of sound production during vocal play and listening to speech sounds (Oller and Eilers, 1992). \n\nIt is evident that environmental factors play an important role.  Researchers suggest that babbling eventually becomes more like the language the child hears, which they refer to as babbling drift (Brown, 1958).  Thus, the language the child hears affects what sounds the child eventually produces.  Evidence of such environmental factors in babbling comes from studies of babbling in deaf infants.  Near the end of the babbling stage, deaf infants have a delay in reduplicated babbling and fewer well formed syllables (Oller & Eilers, 1988).  Similar results have been found with hearing infants who have severe breathing problems and are prevented from babbling due to a surgically implanted tracheal tube.  When these infants resume normal breathing after the tube is removed, their ability to pronounce words is less well developed than other children their age and the sounds they produce are similar to the sounds produced by deaf children (Locke & Pearson, 1990).  These results indicate that babbling may be important in enabling children to practice their pronunciation skills.  Therefore, although physical mechanisms guide early babbling, environmental exposure to speech may be necessary for more complex babbling.\n','Rebecca is making new and different noises!',NULL,'Rebecca has started adding new sounds to her vocal repertoire.

This \"sound play\" does not appear to have any communicative intent or to necessarily have any connection to the activity that the child is engaged in.  Rather, children appear to making the sounds for their own sake and parents may notice repetitions of favorite sounds in the play.  This sound play may also contain the child\'s early words.  Unlike the babbling that children engage in around this time, which is beginning to sound expressive and as though it is real talking, this playing with sounds is not.  While it is clear that hearing infants who never babble can develop speech, researchers have been hesitant to drop babbling from the path to speech (Locke, 1989).

These early gestures are instrumental in nature (Bonniwell Haslett, 1997), used by the infant to request something, such as a toy, to reject something (for example, when the infant pushes an object away), and to hand someone a toy when the infant wants to \"show\" something (Sachs, 1989).  Researchers suggest that the development of these communicative gestures relates to other developments in learning how to accomplish tasks in the environment (Bates et al., 1979).  For example, it is also around nine months of age that a child who cannot reach a toy that is resting on a piece of cloth will pull the cloth toward her to reach the toy.  By about 12 to 14 months, many infants are able to point to gesture what they want (Masur, 1990).  Around 12-15 months, infants are able to point to something and shift their gaze toward the person whose attention they are trying to direct (Lempers, 1979; Lock, Service, Brito, & Chandler, 1989; Masur, 1990).  \n\nIn trying to find out when infants begin to intentionally shift their own gaze and point their own index finger to refer others to objects, researchers have to try to disentangle adult’s supportive actions from infant accomplishment.  The evidence seems to suggest that the infant’s referential pointing is rooted in the complex of acts related to orienting rather than pleading (Locke et al. 1990).  From a developmental perspective then, pointing emerges from actions that are related to attention directing, not from actions that are related to gaining contact with objects through grasping.   The behavior of index finger extension has been traced back to 2 months of age (Trevarthen, 1987).  Fogel and Hannan (1985) found that index finger extensions occurred quite frequently by the third month and by about 6 months, infants begin to point as if to direct their own attention when they are exploring an object that interests them.  By eleven months, they may even augment the point with an arm extension and direct it intentionally towards an object or place (Fogel & Thelan, 1987).  Only at about 12 months, do infants produce manual points as intentionally communicative acts.  At this time they regularly call the caregiver’s attention to an object by pointing with the index finger and they routinely check it out to see if the message is conveyed (Bates et al. 1988).\n\nBy 12 months of age, infants routinely add sounds to their gazes and gestures (Butterworth & Grover, 1990).  These positive vocalizations differ from the vocal demands that often accompany requests.  Research by Bakeman and Adamson (1986) shows that infants produce the gestures of object showing weeks before they produce communicative points towards objects.   However, it may be several weeks before infants regularly look at their caregivers while simultaneously pointing to an object, which would indicate that the pointing is both intentional but also produces a dual directional signal between infant and caregiver (Masur, 1990).\n\nBetween 12 18 months, symbolic or representational gestures emerge.  For example, a child might shrug his shoulders with his hands up to indicate, \"I don\'t know.\"  Researchers have classified symbolic gestures as either iconic or indexic (Acredolo & Goodwyn, 1985, 1988).  An iconic gesture resembles the physical characteristics of the object; for example, a child indicates \"scissors\" with an open closed motion of two fingers.  An indexic gesture depicts an action that co occurs with the object or event; for example, a child indicates \"ball\" with a waving motion of her hands.  Data indicate that infants produce spontaneous gestures that are indexic, thus indicating the importance of function over form.  In a case study of one child, the most common gestures were those for \"flower,\" \"dog,\" \"horse,\" \"out,\" \"up,\" \"hot,\" and \"all gone\" (Acredolo & Goodwyn, 1985).  Symbolic gesturing tends to develop in interactions with parents or around objects (Acredolo & Goodwyn, 1985, 1988; Volterra, 1981.\n\nGesturing increases substantially between 10 to 18 months and begins to decrease around 24 months as children are gaining new words to help them communicate (Lock et al., 1990).  Symbolic gestures complement children\'s verbal vocabulary, with the developmental course being a gesture followed by a verbal label.  According to parents in a longitudinal study, gestures were a phenomenon of the second year, and they seemed to be transitional, easing the children into the use of words.  However, gestures do not drop out altogether when children begin to use their first words.  In fact, gesturing and babbling continue after first words appear, suggesting that the emergence of speech is continuous, rather than abrupt (Vasta, Haith, & Miller, 1992).  Symbolic gestures are eventually replaced almost completely by verbal labels.  Researchers suggest that verbal labels have advantages over gestures for children, such as leaving hands free to do other things (play with toys) and allowing children to communicate to a parent who is in a different room (Acredolo & Goodwyn, 1988).\n\n \nInfants also respond to points by others.  At 12 months, the infant can look in the direction that someone else is pointing if the person is looking in the direction of the pointing.  By the time infants are 17 months old, they can look in the direction of the pointing even if the person is looking a different way (Lempers, Flavell, & Flavell, 1977).\n\nDuring the last quarter of the first year, infants begin to understand and produce acts that allow them to communicate with caregivers about objects.  As objects are drawn into communicative episodes, infants and their caregivers use earlier developing communicative acts such as smiles and cries to communicate to them.  In addition, they begin to use gestures that are composed of vocalizations, manual movements and gaze patterns to serve communicative intentions such as object requesting and referring. \n\nThe infant\'s production of the pointing gesture may be a first step in language development.  Bates, O\'Connell, and Shore (1987) suggest that pointing may be an inherent part of the way we acquire language, something that is innate.  Recent research supports this view that communicative pointing is associated with both comprehension and production of language (Desrochers, Morissette, & Ricard, 1995).  Researchers compared infants who were early and late in their production of communicative pointing.  The early pointers had higher scores on expressive and comprehensive tests of language.  However, there was no relationship between infants\' comprehension and production of pointing.  Infants who understood pointing early did not necessarily produce points early.  This finding is in contrast to findings relating to comprehension and production of language.  There was a strong relationship between the infants\' comprehensive and expressive sections of the language test.  Thus, infants\' understanding and production of words seems to be closely associated to each other.\n','Elena lets Martha know that she is thirsty.',NULL,'Martha breast feeds her daughter Elena.

Because these first words take on many different forms, it is often difficult to say precisely when an infant utters a first word (Menyuk et al. 1986).  This is in part because adults often assimilate infantile inventions such as dada and mama into their vocabulary.  For example, in imitating \"papa,\" infants may say \"ba\" or \"papapa.\" (Also, infants utter these first words in many different situations.  They may say \"papa\" to refer to their father, as well as any male adult, their mother, and even while playing by themselves.)  To avoid being misled by such  terms, researchers often overlook the first word and select as a milestone the first 10 words of productive vocabulary.   Infants usually reach this landmark between 13 and 19 months. Over the next couple months, children continue to learn one word after another.  This does not mean that they not longer babble or that they no longer use their protowords (sounds that stand for words that they used earlier).  In fact, it is common for all three forms to exist at once.  \n\nMost of children\'s first words are general nominals.  These are words like \"cat,\" \"dog,\" or \"ball.\"  These \"object words\" tend to be easier to grasp than \"action words\" (Greenfield & Smith, 1976; Schwartz & Leonard, 1984) and although some children tend to prefer action words, the majority of children learn object words first (Nelson, 1981).  First words are often directly tied to function--those that help the child communicate information (labels such as ball, baby, dog) or are facilitative in terms of social interaction (bye-bye, hi, no) (Garvey, 1984).  Though Mervis (1987) points out that infants earliest vocabularies contain words for objects and occurrences that really interest them.  They also enjoy producing words and even 12 month-old infants may label objects for the sheer pleasure of naming.   Some researchers urge caution however,  (e.g. Griffiths, 1986; Nelson, 1985) and point out that first words are a mere veneer of language and suggest that infants may only appear to be acquiring words.  Infants may still be using conventional words in the same context-dependent way in which they use other more literal communicative actions such as pouting or pointing.  They may not yet appreciate that these sounds are linguistic symbols with a broader range of applicability.   When a word is used as a symbol, it gains meaning not only from its placement within an ongoing communicative event, but also from its location within a linguistic event.  Many first words seem to be context bound and may only be used in a specific action routine, e.g. bam when knocking a tower or duck when placing a toy duck in the bath.   However, it must be pointed out that other researchers e.g. Mervis (1987) has produced evidence to show that 10-word vocabularies always contain at least a few words that are used in contexts other than the situation in which they were originally produced. \n \nChildren learn words more quickly if they include sounds and syllables they are already using.  This suggests that early speech is a continuation of babbling skills (Schwartz et al., 1987).  Also, babbling does not stop when the infant begins using first words.  Infants continue babbling as well as using communicative and symbolic gesturing after they produce words (Dobrich & Scarborough, 1984; Vihman & Miller, 1988).  According to Vasta, Haith, and Miller (1992), the findings that words with familiar sounds are more quickly learned and that babbling and gesturing still occur after first words appear suggest that the emergence of speech is continuous, not abrupt.  The preverbal period seems to be a building block for later language development.\n','Aaron says \"ba\" when he wants or receives \"juice\".',NULL,'Aaron has been bottle fed from birth.

Children gradually develop various stress and intonation patterns.  Their babbling begins to sound so much like a foreign language that researchers label this type of babbling as \"expressive jargon\" (Gesell and Thompson, 1934).  Expressive jargon or \"jargon babbling\" involves strings of sounds that contain different stresses and different intonation patterns. \n\n \nIt is one of the last forms of babbling that babies produce and it often happens about the same time that they are beginning to produce their very first words.  However, while some infants use expressive jargon for several months, other infants quickly move on to using first words (Stark, 1979).  Expressive jargon shows that children are able to mimic the sounds of intonation (Nakazima, 1962; Cruttenden, 1982) It often sounds so much like real words that one has to listen carefully to realize that it\'s not.   Furthermore, children use different intonations to communicate different things.  For example, a child may use rising intonation for requests and falling intonation for comments (Halliday, 1975).  In addition to showing sensitivity to the intonations of language, children often use certain sounds to mean certain things.  In one study, a child made the sound \"eee\" when he wanted something, but he used \"uuu\" to indicate that he disapproved of something (Engel, 1973, as cited in Sachs, 1989).  Thus, expressive jargon serves as a link between preverbal communication and speech.  Children also often demonstrate sensitivity to certain contexts for speech in their expressive jargon.  It is not uncommon to see a child using expressive jargon in response to a toy telephone or while looking at the pages of a book (Sachs, 1989). In these later stages of  babbling, children use certain sounds to mean certain things.  \n\nResearchers used to believe that children babbled all of the possible sounds that they could make and then depending upon the language spoken, certain sounds were reinforced and the child began to limit their speech production to that.(Mowrer, 1954; Winitz, 1969).  More recent research suggests that this view is overly simplified.  Instead, there are overall developmental patterns that children universally go through.  These appear to reflect the growth of the physical structures that enable children to make certain sounds.  For example, \"b\" and \"g\" are often learned early whereas sounds that require more control such as \"s\" and \"f\" are learned later. (See Sachs, 1989, for an excellent discussion).\n','Debbie wants every object to have a name.',NULL,'Debbie is sitting on top of the washing machine and watching her father sort the wet laundry.

Despite this, research shows that the newborn can attend to the world in a organized way and can learn and recall information from it.

In early infancy, babies learn that they can affect their environment as a result of the predictability of their distress-relief experiences with caregivers (Campos, Barrett, Lamb, Goldsmith & Stenberg 1983; Lamb & Campos, 1982; Lamb 1981a, 1981b).  They learn that their crying elicits certain kinds of responses and they start to expect those responses.  Based on their awareness of how their caregivers typically respond, infants develop strategies to bring about desired responses.  Lamb and Malkin (1986) studied the associations between an infants cries, the predictable pattern of intervention (pick-up) by caregivers, and the development of the infant\'s expectations for this pick-up response.  The researchers observed that from as early as one month old, many infants began to soothe from distress and stop crying just before they were picked up by the caregiver, showing that they had formed expectations for their caregivers response to their actions.  When the caregiver violated the infants\' expectations and resisted pick-up, infants as young as three months old increased their cries and oriented toward the resisting adult.  They are learning to expect which events and behaviors lead to which other events and showing that they anticipate the action.    \n\nThe ability to make predictions based on environmental cues allows infants to develop behavioral strategies used to reach an anticipated outcome or goal.  For instance, infants increase the amount of performance in some way, such as crying louder or kicking harder, in order to elicit a response from the environment   (Willats, 1990).

By the time infants are two months old, there is clear evidence for this ability (Olson & Sherman, 1983).  This has enabled some very clever research which makes it possible to know if babies detect the differences between certain kinds of patterns.

Very importantly, it shows that babies are learning patterns and remembering them! (at least for a certain length of time).

These very young infants are learning the patterns or \"contingencies\" in their environment and are seeking a match or \"goodness of fit\" between their behaviors and those of their caregivers.  Haith, Hazen and Goodman (1988) studied the ability of infants to make predictions based on stimulus cues and direct their actions based on these cues by testing the reaction times of infants when presented with either a predictable left/right visual stimulus or one that was randomly located.  The researchers observed faster reaction times and more anticipatory fixations when a predictable series of events was presented to the infants three and a half months old.  From this finding the researchers concluded that infants can perceive a predictable pattern in a series of events and can develop short-term expectations for those events, which are used to guide behavior.  Babies demonstrate this increasing ability in their everyday actions.  For instance, infants often move their hands towards their mouths and open their mouths in anticipation (Butterworth & Hopkins, 1988).  Papousek and Bernstein (1969) explain that just as an infant can learn that a set of internal signals signifies a certain physiological imbalance, he or she can also learn that certain behavioral responses can prevent such an imbalance, or more generally, to achieve a desired outcome.

Babies can adapt to a schedule as long as too rigid and you attempt to build it around #first#’s schedule.   #first# may not be better able to prolong intervals between feedings and #he/she# may be improving #his/her# efforts to quiet #him/her#self.  ','For Mamiko and her baby, there is no problem.  She sleeps with her baby and whenever Sayuri cries during the night, she spontaneously draws her to her breast and feeds her.  Although Sayuri does wake at night, her mother is not at all concerned.  In fact, she considers Sayuri as sleeping through the night.  Most parents in this country, however, have their babies sleep in a different bed and more often than not in a different room.  Parents believe this will help the baby learn to organize #him/her#self and become autonomous.  Many parents succeeded in dealing with this issue by relying on certain routines and rituals to help their baby sleep.  They place the baby in the same place each time, in the same position, with the same songs or music.  They realize the baby can now cue in to these routines and learn to associate them with feeding or with sleep. ','It is true that while some babies may easily develop robust sleep/wake routines or patterns and can tolerate three hour breaks between feedings, most babies need support to achieve that.  They need routines, predictable sequences that convey a message to the baby that this is a time for sleep or this is feeding time.  For the two month old baby, developing clear cut behavior patterns is such a challenge, especially for the highly active baby.

In the first months of life, babies engage in a number of strategies to help them get what they want.  These are called \"forward search\" strategies because they involve trying out different things and seeing what is accomplished. The ability to make predictions enables the infant to develop behavioral strategies based upon what they \"expect\" will happen. The infant tries out different things in order to seek a problem solution or reach a desired state.  According to a review by Willats (1990), some approaches to problem-solving that are present in the early months of life: 1) Babies increase the amount of their \"performance\" in some way (crying louder; kicking harder, etc), for instance, infants will often increase their performance or \"turn up the volume\" by crying louder or kicking harder, in order to elicit a response from the environment. For instance, two to five month old infants learned that the more they kicked the more a mobile would turn and music would play.  Two month olds increased their normal amount of kicking to make the mobile turn and music play.  (Rovee-Collier, 1993).  2) Babies also use spatial context for guidance (Butterworth & Hopkins, 1988).  For instance, babies use information to guide goal-oriented behaviors such as using body knowledge to help them know where their thumb is in relation to their mouths.\n\nCareful observations have documented physical and emotional evidence that infants are anticipating an outcome based on their expectations and goal-directed actions. For instance, infants often move their hands towards their mouths and open their mouths in anticipation (Butterworth & Hopkins, 1988).  Papousek and Bernstein recorded infants facial and affective responses in conditioning experiments and saw that by three months old, infants seemed to look as though they were solving problems.  The facial expressions of these infants resembled expressions such as concentration, surprise, disappointment, tension or release. These expressions suggest that infants\' responses are more than just a set of conditioned responses as researchers used to think.  Papousek and Bernstein observed that when infants attained the strategy that allowed them to accomplish a certain goal, the infants showed signs of release and pleasure and sometimes appeared to experience more pleasure from solving the problem than they did when receiving the reward.  \n\nIn order to engage in goal-directed behaviors, babies need to anticipate that certain events make other events happen.  They begin learning which events and behaviors signal which outcomes from the earliest days of life.

Ira\'s mom is busy getting his older sister into bed.  She hears Ira beginning to fuss but decides to wait to see if he\'ll go back to sleep so she can finish helping his sister.  Soon Ira begins to move around even more, his arms now out of the covers and he begins to fuss.  He is fully awake now and when his mother doese not respond to his fussing,  he begins to intensify his kicking and crying.  This gets mom\'s attention and realizing that he\'s not about to fall back to sleep, she heads in to comfort him.','Ira has developed a set of expectations about his mother\'s response patterns.  When she doesn\'t respond as expected to his early cries and fussing, he intensified his behavior, \"trying things out\" until he got the response he wanted.  Ira\'s increased fussing serves his goal and soon mom appears to comfort him.  While Ira doesn\'t reason about what actions will bring about the desired response, in the end his increased actions may serve the same purpose.  Indeed, if slightly increased crying didn\'t bring mom, he might have kept intensifying his behaviors until his needs were met.  This doesn\'t mean that Ira\'s mom should have dropped everything as soon as she heard him begin to fuss. During sleep, babies cycle in and out of deep and light sleep (sleep with rapid eye movements).  During the peaks of the light sleep cycle, babies often become aroused. The baby may startle, throw out his arms and legs,  begin to thrash about and cry.   This is a normal cycle and often the baby is able to resume #his/her# sleep patterns all by #him/her#self.  If a parent were to pick #him/her# up it would actually interrupt this cycle and prevent the baby from developing a solid sleep pattern.  Some babies have the capacity to bring themselves back down to sleep, if given the opportunity.  While babies often are able to get their hands into their mouths to console themselves from early on, they have begun to refine this ability during these weeks.  Many babies now can get their fingers in their mouths with ease and can quiet themselves.  Beyond this, Ira was able to communicate to mom that he needed her when he really did.

Researchers Kellman and Spelke (1983) showed babies what appeared to be a moving rod behind a block of wood (so that the middle of the rod was always hidden by the wood) until they were no longer interested in it.  There was no way for the babies to know for certain whether it was one rod or two pieces of a rod moving in tandem because the block of wood obscured the middle part.  Then they showed babies either a whole rod moving back and forth without the wood in front of it or two rods moving in tandem.  Whichever one the babies saw as being new and different, they should show more interest it. The babies showed greater interest in the two pieces of rod moving in tandem!  This suggests that they inferred that the rod moving behind the block was a whole rod.  This was not the case with newborns (Slater et al, 1990) suggesting that the ability to make such an inference develops in the early months of life.  Research by Kellman, Spelke, and Short (1986) confirmed the earlier Kellman and Spelke (1983) findings.  This relates to early understanding of the concept of object permanence.

Renee Baillargeon (1987) developed an experiment where a box was placed behind a wooden board, the board was on a horizontal axle so that if the board was pushed, it would swing.  First the child could see the box placed behind the board, then the experimenter set the board in motion.  In one condition, the board stopped and swung the other way when it hit the box.  In another condition, using lighting and mirrors, the board  appeared to be swinging right through where the box had been (even though the box was no longer there) making it appear as though a seemingly impossible event was occurring if the box was still there.  Babies reacted with surprise and stared at the impossible event longer revealing an understanding that the box still existed and would be in the way of the swinging.  If babies are capable of object permanence at such a young age, why do parents tend to see children demonstrate it later?  In typical environments, babies may not have a means to demonstrate their understanding.  As other abilities develop (such as the ability to coordinate visually directed grasping around 4 to 5 months old and intentional means-end problem-solving at around 7 months old) children become more able to demonstrate their emerging understandings of object permanence and in a wider variety of contexts.\n\nObject permanence involves mental representation.  This is a fundamental concept. Babies attain the ability to hold mental representations of events in their minds--to formulate a mental picture and to be able to remember what happened.  Piagetian researchers used to believe that babies were unable to formulate such concepts until they were about 18 months old. However, more recent research suggests that the ability to mentally represent events develops over time and that children are able to do so to different extents at different times depending upon what the concepts are and how they are demonstrated.  For instance, a child might imitate something that he or she saw in the past at 9 months and yet, not until around 20 months would that same child talk about something in the past.  That same child might not create external symbolic representations of objects (such as playdough snakes) until 36 months [See Visual/Spatial LW - 36 Months- Modeling Representational Shapes From Playdough.] \n','Early Perception of Object Permanence',NULL,'Senna is propped up in her stroller.

By the time babies are around 6 months old, they are beginning to more actively experiment with making things happen [See Logic &Number- 6 Months-Doing Things and Discovering What Happens.]  Babies\' understanding of causality grows increasingly complex in the coming months [See related information in Logic & Number LW- 9 Months- Growing Causal Perception., 27 Months- Seeking Explanations of Cause and Effect, and 42 Months-Making Causal Inferences Between Initial and End States.]  For example, between 6 and 10 month old babies have been shown to distinguish between the direction of causes and effects (Leslie, 1984; Leslie & Keeble, 1987; Oakes & Cohen, 1990).  Eleven month olds demonstrated some understanding of the behavior of causal mechanisms (Baillargeon & Kotovsky, 1991) and suggested some understanding of causality in relation to size and force.\n\n \nChildren\'s ability to understand causal relationships continues to grow as they grow older. Research by Bullock, Gelman, and Baillargeon (1982) suggests that children demonstrate expectations based upon adult-like principles by the time they are preschoolers even if they can\'t necessarily talk about what they understand.  By adult-like principles, they mean that children understand the following kinds of concepts: that causes tend to precede their effects (an understanding of priority or temporal ordering) (Bullock & Gelman, 1979); that one can look for the thing or \"mechanism\" that caused the effect; and that they expect that physical events are caused such that they are unwilling to allow for causeless events (determinism). \n','Learning what makes things happen',NULL,'Sara now likes to spend a lot of time on the floor.

Around now, babies are strongly demonstrating that they are able to use their sense of timing to adjust their behaviors to parental activities.  Researchers suggest that some evidence is apparent  at as early as 3 months of age (e.g. Lester, Hoffman, & Brazelton, 1985; Stern, 1977).  \n\nExperiential time refers to our subjective sense of time. Logical time involves thinking about time as a continuum that can be reasoned about, so if two kids start running at the same time and one stops later than the other, one can reason that the one who stopped later, ran longer.  Conventional time refers to how we parse and measure time in units, the designs that we create for creating collective measures such as days, weeks, years, and so forth (Siegler, 1991).\n\nChildren have been shown to adjust to certain patterns of caregiving.  Researchers have studied the patterns of babies\' sucking and their mothers\' gently jiggling them.  They found a subtle type of timing and turn-taking that is well-established from only a few days after birth.  Looking at the pattern in depth, Kenneth Kaye and colleagues (Kaye, 1982; Kaye & Wells, 1980) found that while the pattern starts with babies\' natural sucking patterns (Wolff, 1966) (what infants would do even if they weren\'t being held and jiggled), mothers respond to this pattern in how and when they jiggle, and that babies increasingly adapt to the patterns.  They didn\'t start as often sucking while being jiggled and they started soon after the jiggling stopped (Kaye, 1982; Kaye & Wells, 1980). \n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:29:57','2012-08-22 12:29:57'),(2538,'ln_5_1','Recognizing that Adding or Subtracting One Changes the Amount','Researchers gave devised some clever ways to assess infants\' understanding of numerosity and have revealed some surprising competencies on behalf of very young children.

Some recent research suggests that children as young as 6-8 months of age perceive one to one correspondence (Starkey, Spelke, & Gelman, 1990).  Researchers knew that around 6-8 months of age, babies could distinguish between the equivalence or non-equivalence of small amounts. [See Logic & Number LW- 7 Months- Sensitivity to Equivalence/Inequivalence.] (Antel & Keating, 1983; Starkey & Cooper, 1980a, 1980b).  In order to demonstrate that babies were doing more than subitizing, a visual process for detecting numerosities, Starkey, Spelke, and Gelman (1990) introduced numerical quantities in different modalities, for instance, a sequence of sounds.  They also compared babies ability to detect different numbers of sounds as compared to visual quantities.  Infants, six to eight months old were able to detect the matching sets of visual and auditory stimuli, which strongly suggests the ability to use one to one correspondence.  They were able to compare the relationships between the sets.  Starkey, Spelke, and Gelman (1990) also tested 6-9 month olds on the relationship between the sounds and the visual stimuli, but this time they presented the visual stimuli, then afterwards presented the sounds.  The infants still showed increased looking time for the matching sound and visual sequences.  One to one correspondence is a basic number concept and is fundamental to the ability to count.  [See related Logic &Number LW- 24 Months- Demonstrating Understanding of Object Permanence.]   Findings such as these are of special interest to researchers because of their interest in learning whether babies are actually born with certain conceptual capacities having to do with number, causality, and so forth.

This is a way of discovering how things work.  It involves doing something, finding out what happens next, and inferring a causal relationship between the two.  This helps babies discover how things work.  Does this mean that babies are thinking \"If I toss this doll, what will happen?  Will tossing it always make that happen?\" This is a tricky question because it asks whether the child\'s actions are intentional to discover a result or whether the child simply does them and then notices the result.  While this type of hypothetical reasoning appears to be beyond the capacities of the typical 6 month old, there is some research to suggest that babies can remember sequences of events that they have learned and act in ways to make them happen again.  Six month old babies who learned to kick to make a mobile play music and turn, showed evidence that they remembered this up to two weeks later by increasing their amount of kicking (Rovee-Collier, 1993).  \n\nAs young as four and five months old, infants notice events that occur close in time (contiguity) and use this information to infer that things are related (Leslie, 1982).  Six to ten month old babies have been shown to distinguish between the direction of causes and effects (Leslie, 1984; Leslie & Keeble, 1987; Oakes & Cohen, 1990).  Babies\' understanding of causality grows increasingly complex in the coming months [See related information in Logic & Number LW- 9 Months- Growing Causal Perception., 27 Months- Seeking Explanations of Cause and Effect, and 42 Months-Making Causal Inferences Between Initial and End States.]  Eleven month olds demonstrated some understanding of the behavior of causal mechanisms (Baillargeon & Kotovsky, 1991) and suggested some understanding of causality in relation to size and force.  Children\'s ability to understand causal relationships continues to grow as they grow older.  Research by Bullock, Gelman, and Baillargeon (1982) suggests that children demonstrate expectations based upon adult-like principles by the time they are preschoolers even if they can\'t necessarily talk about what they understand.  By adult-like principles, they mean that children understand the following kinds of concepts: that causes tend to precede their effects (an understanding of priority or temporal ordering) (Bullock & Gelman, 1979); that one can look for the thing or \"mechanism\" that caused the effect; and that they expect that physical events are caused such that they are unwilling to allow for causeless events (determinism). \n','Finding out what causes what.',NULL,'Benny sits on her highchair playing with her favorite toy, Diny.

Research conducted by Willats (1984, 1985a, as reported in 1990) suggests that while children can intentionally work towards goals at younger ages, between 6 and 8 months, babies demonstrate early means-end problem-solving.  In studies of search behavior (when an object is hidden and infants are expected to try to recover it) children between 6 and 8 months were successful at finding the object.  However, around 7 months old, there was a clear change in how youngsters accomplished the task.  Instead of a random series of acts that resulted in finding a toy as happened at 6 months (Willats, 1984), children fixated on the cup under which a toy was hidden, suggesting that they understood that the cup had to be removed to get at the toy.  Researchers compared this behavior to a control trials where children had the cup but no toy underneath it. Children fixated on the cup at much higher levels when a toy was under it than when it wasn\'t.  Willats contrasted this behavior to the ability of five month olds to reach out for an object in the dark.  In the case of the five month old, the behavior is direct whereas for the seven month old, there is the intervening step of moving the cup that is not directly connected to getting the toy.   Further evidence came from a study (Willats, 1985b) where the child was given a cloth with a toy either at the far end or closer.  The researchers watched to see whether the babies fixated on the toy and acted to pull the toy near to them or whether they seemed to attain the toy through a series of unrelated, random acts such as playing with the cloth, looking away, and so on.  For younger children (6 and 7 months), how far away the toy was placed influenced whether babies intentionally went after the toy whereas by eight months, they used means-end problem-solving to get the toy whether or not it was placed near or far.  By 12 months old, children demonstrate the ability to plan two to three steps in solving a problem, such as retrieving a toy (Willatts  & Rosie, 1988).

This represents early knowledge of equivalence and non-equivalence.  Studies with 6 to 8 month olds showed that they could discriminate between two rows of dots with between two and four dots in each row (Antell & Keating, 1983; Starkey & Cooper, 1980a, 1980b).  The experimental designs controlled for differences in brightness, density, and length of the row.  Babies were habituated to rows of a certain length and they dishabituated when shown rows with differing amounts (up to four).   Prior to 12 months, babies appear to be able to discriminate amounts up to four.  Starkey and Cooper (1980) found that 4- to 7 and 1/2 month old infants were able to discriminate two from three items.  They were not able to tell the difference between four and six items.  Ten- to  twelve month olds discriminated two from three items but not four from five (Strauss & Curtis, 1981). \n\nIn order to demonstrate that babies were doing more than subitizing, a visual process for detecting numerosities, Starkey, Spelke, and Gelman (1990) introduced numerical quantities in different modalities, for instance, a sequence of sounds.  They also compared babies ability to detect different numbers of sounds as compared to visual quantities.  Infants, six to eight months old were able to distinguish between the equivalence or non-equivalence of the sets.  Understandings of equivalence and nonequivalence appear to depend upon understandings of one-to-one correspondence (instead of some form of visual grouping to compare the sets (Starkey, Spelke, & Gelman, 1990)) and both understandings seem to be present between 6-8 months.  One to one correspondence is a basic number concept and is fundamental to the ability to count.

Spelke and colleagues (1990) found that four month olds do not see to notice anything wrong with a ball floating in the air as if they don\'t think that gravity should apply. In a clever experiment where researchers (Baillargeon & Hanko-Summers, 1990) rigged up certain objects so that they did not fall when they should have, 7 and 1/2 to 9 and 1/2 month old infants expressed greater interest in these trick arrangements than in those that looked normal.  Infants were only able to do so up to a certain level of complexity and their ability to show the understanding in varied contexts was limited.  Once the arrangements became too complex, infants looked at trick and normal arrangements equally.  \n\n \nIn part, how capable children appear depends upon how complex the problem is. Later research ( Spelke et al., 1992a; Baillargeon et al., 1992) found that by the time infants are between 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 months of age they expect an object to fall to the ground when released in mid air or pushed off a supporting surface.  Researchers (Baillargeon et al., 1992; Spelke, et al. 1992b) have found, however, that not until approximately 6 1/2 months of age or later do infants show any response when faced with a stable yet apparently unsupported object.  In an experiment conducted by Needham & Baillargeon (1993) to explore infants understanding of object support, 5.5 and 6.5 month old infants were shown an object being pushed along a platform support until only its corner was on the platform.  While the 6.5 month olds seemed surprised when the object did not fall, and thereby expecting the object to fall without the adequate support, the 5.5 months olds in the study did not.  The findings of these studies suggest that typically by 4.5 months of age infants understand that an object will fall when it loses all contact with a support and perceive any amount of support sufficient to support an object.  By approximately 6.5 months of age, infants begin to recognize that it is the amount of contact between an object and it\'s support that keeps it stable, and that an object can fall even when only partially supported.  Needham and Baillargeon (1993) describe infants initial understanding of gravity and object support as focusing on the presence or absence of contact between and object and its support.  This understanding develops to later include the amount of  contact between an object and its support in determining an object\'s stability.\n \nKeil (1979) demonstrated that 18 to 24 month olds expect that an object will fall if it has no support but also expect it to remain in place if it has some support even if the support is not enough to actually hold up the object.  However, in the Keil experiments, the task was somewhat more difficult in that it used three objects and the supports either held up the top piece like a bridge or two supports but only the left end of the top piece was actually supported.  \n\nBaillargeon and Hanko-Summers (1990) raise the interesting question of whether children\'s understanding grows from actually manipulating objects in their world or from observations of objects.   Needham and Baillargeon (1993) suggest that infants\' understanding of support concepts develop as a result of more experiences with and more advanced manipulations of objects.  Typically by  5 to 6 and 1/2 months of age, infants are beginning to sit in chairs and walkers and are likely to be seated in front of tables or trays where they have the opportunity to drop objects on surfaces and to observe how objects are supported.  As they begin to sit on their own in these situations, infants of this age are likely to observe and manipulate how bottles, cups and toys will fall when not sufficiently supported.  It is this type of experience to which the researchers attribute the more developed understanding that 6.5 month olds have of object support and the recognition that it is the amount of support which is important in determining an object\'s stability.\n','Emma is surprised when her duck falls into the box.',NULL,'Emma’s father, Joseph, stretches a sheet over an empty box.

This is a demonstration of understanding object permanence.  At one time, based on the earlier, Piagetian work, researchers believed that children younger than nine months old were unable to grasp the concept that objects are permanent  More recently, however, clever experiments have shown that in certain conditions, babies as young as four months can demonstrate object permanence [See related Logic & Number LW-4 Months- Early Perception of Object Permanence.]. If babies are capable of object permanence at such a young age, why do parents tend to see children demonstrate it later?  As other abilities develop (such as the ability to coordinate visually directed grasping around 4 to 5 months old and intentional means-end problem-solving at around 7 months old [See Logic & Number LW, 7 Months-Early Intentional Means-End Problem-Solving] children become more able to demonstrate their emerging understandings of object permanence and in a wider variety of contexts.  \n\nSome research suggests that younger babies (8 to 12 months) meet with greater success at tracking hidden objects when they don\'t need to wait very long before searching them out.  The longer they waited, the more errors they made (Baillargeon, DeVos, & Graber, 1989; Harris, 1989; Wellman, Cross, & Bartsch, 1986).  These errors are attributed in part to the limitations on infants\' short term memory and  suggests that children\'s search behaviors grow less fragile as their ability to remember grows.  This research suggests that as children grow older, they are better able to hold items in their short term memory for use in searching for a hidden object (Wellman, Cross & Bartsch, 1986 in Harris, 1989).  \n\nObject permanence involves mental representation.  This is a fundamental concept. Babies attain the ability to hold mental representations of events in their minds--to formulate a mental picture and to be able to remember what happened.  Piagetian researchers used to believe that babies were unable to formulate such concepts until they were about 18 months old. However, more recent research suggests that the ability to mentally represent events develops over time and that children are able to do so to different extents at different times depending upon what the concepts are and how they are demonstrated.  For instance, a child might imitate something that he or she saw in the past at 9 months and yet, not until around 20 months would that same child talk about something in the past.  That same child might not create external symbolic representations of objects (such as playdough snakes) until 36 months [See Visual/Spatial LW - 36 Months- Modeling Representational Shapes From Playdough.]\n','Dave hides Haley’s toy.',NULL,'Dave is playing with his daughter Haley.

One of the reasons researchers in child development are so interested in deferred imitation is that it implies that the child remembers what he or she saw.  It suggests that he or she forms a mental image of what has happened, stores that image, and recalls and enacts it later.  Researchers have found that children as young as 9 months old are capable of deferred imitation. Meltzoff (1988a) had nine month old infants watch an adult perform a sequence of actions on objects that were new to the babies (for instance, pushing a button to produce a beeping sound).  Then after a 24 hour delay, the babies were given the opportunity to play with the same objects.  Interestingly enough, they reproduced many of the behaviors that the adults had engaged in.  This was in comparison to babies who had not seen the adults model certain behaviors.  Meltzoff also demonstrated that 14 month olds could imitate behaviors that they had seen a whole week earlier (1988b).\n\nSimilarly, Case (1985) found that 4 to 8 month old infants who saw an experimenter make a bell ring by pushing down on a balance beam connected to it, tried to reach out and touch the beam in that spot themselves.  12 to 18 month-olds imitated an adult solution of a harder problem, pushing on one end of a beam so the other end went up and rang a bell.  \n\nOne of the fundamental concepts that babies attain is the ability to hold mental representations of events in their minds--to formulate a mental picture and to be able to remember what happened.  Piagetian researchers used to believe that babies were unable to formulate such concepts until they were about 18 months old.

Davis is exhibiting deferred imitation:  he is repeating familiar actions after seeing them, with a sizable delay between the stimulus and his response.  This indicates that Davis’s memory has developed to the extent that he can recall which actions are appropriate with certain objects (such as talking on the phone).

Therefore, parents may not realize that their children hold certain expectations about how causality works.  In a series of clever experiments, researchers showed 6 month olds (Leslie, 1984; Leslie & Keeble, 1987) and 10 month olds (Oakes & Cohen, 1990) a series of events in which one thing causes another thing to happen.  Researchers showed children a film in which a red brick appears to hit and launch a green brick until the children no longer viewed it as novel. Then they ran the film backwards so that the green brick appeared to hit and launch the red one.  Babies responded with interest suggesting that they viewed the two events as different.  In one experiment, babies as young as six months responded in this way.  A later experiment found the response in 10 month olds but not 6 month olds (Oakes & Cohen, 1990).  Further research with 11 month olds showed that they recognized some events as more interesting (and perhaps less likely or even impossible) from the perspective of how causal relationships work.  Researchers (Baillargeon & Kotovsky, 1991) showed children a possible event where a cylinder rolled down a ramp and hit a toy bug.  Then they were shown a second  cylinder that rolled down and hit a toy bug, but this time the toy bug was launched much further by the impact.  In one test condition, the second cylinder was smaller than the original one (an impossible event given how far the bug was flung), in the other test condition, the second cylinder was much bigger than the original one ( a possible event).  Infants were much more interested in the case where the smaller cylinder launched the bug further, suggesting that they understood some things about size and force.\n\nChildren\'s ability to understand causal relationships continues to grow as they grow older.  [See related Logic &Number LW -27 Months-Seeking Explanations of Cause and Effect and 42 Months- Making Causal Inferences Between Initial and End States.]  Research by Bullock, Gelman, and Baillargeon (1982) suggest that children demonstrate expectations based upon adult-like principles by the time they are preschoolers even if they can\'t necessarily talk about what they understand.  By adult-like principles, they mean that children understand the following kinds of concepts: that causes tend to precede their effects (an understanding of priority or temporal ordering) (Bullock & Gelman, 1979); that one can look for the thing or \"mechanism\" that caused the effect; and that they expect that physical events are caused such that they are unwilling to allow for causeless events (determinism).\n','Benjamin anticipates water splashing into his eyes.',NULL,'While Jeff is bathing his son Benjamin, he notices that Benjamin splashes at the water and squints his eyes at the same time.

Kurt Fischer (1980) refers to these coordinated relationships as mappings which help the child organize their behavior and predict new outcomes.  One example of this is the development of the ability to predict an object\'s weight based on its size, which allows infants to adjust their grasping strategy for different sized objects.  As reported by Willats (1990), research by Mounoud and Hauert (1982) suggests that between 9 and 13 months old, babies can make predictions about the weight of an object based on it\'s size.  Mounoud and Hauert (1982) tested this ability by examining infants\' reactions when a heavy object, to which they had been prompted to grasp several times, was replaced by an object identical in size but lighter in weight.  The researchers observed that after substituting the heavy object with the lighter one, the youngest infants in the study (6 to 8 months) did not exhibit any noticable signs of surprise, but that the older infants (9-16 months) would stare at the substituted object or began to shake, appearing surprised by the change in weight. \n\nMounoud and Hauert (1982) also examined infants\' ability to anticipate the weight of an object by handing a series of large and small objects in increasing and decreasing order to infants aged 9-13 months old, and observed how the infants adjusted their grasp for large and small objects.  The researchers observed that upon grasping the objects, the speed of movement and the drop of the arm in 9 -13 months old was proportional to the weight of the objects, while 14-16 month old infants were able to grasp the objects of various weights without a significant difference in speed or arm drop.  Mounoud and Hauert suggest that this indicates a difference in ability to predict weight based on size, as the younger infants distinguished the weight of the objects during, rather than before, the grasping action, while the older infants first predicted the weight of the object based on it\'s size and adjusted their grasp of each object accordingly.   The researchers infer from these differences in behavior, that at approximately 9 months of age, infants begin to identify and take action upon an object according to its perceived size and predicted weight. \n\nSimilarly, research by Fagard and Jaque (1996) report that the shift from unimanual to bimanual grasping of large objects occurs around 11 months of age, when infants begin to adjust their grasp of a novel object in anticipation of its weight.\n','Clarabel anticipates that a large box will be heavy.',NULL,'Ferdinand is watching his daughter Clarabel.

The researcher reasoned that if 9 month olds could not plan, babies would act similarly in each case (moving the block and pulling the cloth) until they got the the point where they couldn\'t pull the toy.  If they could plan, when they could get the toy they would and when they couldn\'t, they would do other things like play with the block.  Nine month olds behaved differently in the different cases, suggesting that they can plan.  Willats and Rosie (1988) then tested 12 month olds on an extended version of the task.  In this case, there were three steps to getting the toy.  This time there was a string on the cloth that was or wasn\'t attached to the toy.  The child had to 1) move the barrier to get the cloth 2) pull the cloth to get the string 3) pull the string  to get the toy.

It lasts until 4 months (disappearing within a range of 3-6 months). \nThe Sucking Reflex- If an index finger is inserted into a baby\'s mouth by 3-4 centimeters, he or she will suck on it rhythmically.  This reflex becomes stronger and more regular after a baby is 3-4 days old.  By the time the baby is 2 months old, the sucking is a voluntary movement.  When babies have just been fed, they are less likely to demonstrate this reflex.\nOther reflexes include, the following hand to mouth reflexes:\nBabkin Reflex - If you press on both of a baby\'s palm when he or she is lying on his/her back, the mouth will open , eyes close and head will turn to a straight position.  It lasts until a baby is about 3 months old though it weakens after about one month.  Can be a test of the health of the Central Nervous System.\nPalmar Mental Reflex - Sometimes grouped with the Babkin Reflex, here the infant chin lifts up when the base of the palms are scratched. \nand the following grasp-related reflexes:\n \nBabinski- If you gently stroke a baby\'s foot from heel to toes, his or her big toe will flex and other toes will extend.  By one year of age, it disappears but the plantar flexion of the big toe replaces it and is permanent. Can be a test of the lower spine defects if missing.\nPalmar (Grasping)- If you press a finger or an object against an infant\'s palm, he or she will grasp the object or the finger.  The grasp is strong enough to support the infant\'s weight.  By 3 months it weakens, by one year it disappears and by 4-5 months children are using a voluntary grasp. \nPlantar (Toe Grasp)- If you apply pressure against the balls of an infant\'s feet, their toes will flex, until they are about 8-10 months of age. Can be a test of the lower spine if missing. \n\nA number of reflexes resemble movements that the infant voluntarily learns later.  These include reflexes such as the crawling, stepping, and \"swimming\" reflexes:\nCrawling- If infants are placed on their stomachs and pressure is applied to the soles of the feet, they make crawling-type movements of the arms and legs.  Typically this disappears by 3 to 4 months.\nStepping- If you hold the baby upright and tilt him/her gently to one side, he or she will make stepping movements. It lasts until about 3 months old.  Though some research suggests that it can be extended and that it transforms into new forms as the child grows towards walking (Thelen, 1995)\nSwimming Reflex- If infants are placed on their stomachs in or over water, they will make rhythmic swimming-type movements, flexor and extensor movements.  This reflex has been noted in children as young as 11 days old (McGraw, 1939).\nOther reflexes include:\nTonic Neck- Placing a baby on his or her back, makes the baby tend to turn their head to that side and  extend that  arm and leg.  They flex muscles on the opposite side.  It lasts until about 4 months of age. [ See LW 4 Mos. Suppressing the Tonic Neck Reflex.]\nMoro- This reflex is brought on by either a loud sound or bang, dropping the baby\'s head a few inches, or quickly lowering the baby six inches while the bay is positioned horizontally.  The baby\'s arms reach out with his or her hands fanned out, then he /she grasps them back together clenched, the spine arches back.  It lasts until about 5 months of age.  It can be a test of the Central Nervous System, if missing or weak.  \nBiceps- The biceps muscle will contract if you tap on the tendon.  It is most noticeable in the first few days of life. Can be a test of depression of congenital muscular disease (if it is missing).\nBlink- Babies close their eyelids when a light flashes or a puff of air hits their eyes.  This reflex does not disappear and it protects the eyes.\nPatellar Tendon (Knee Jerk)- Tapping on the kneecap or tendon below the patella causes the quick extension of the knee.  It weakens some after the first two days.  Can be a test of depression, muscle disease or excitability. \nWithdrawal- Pricking the sole of a baby\'s foot makes their leg  flex.  It is most noticeable in the first 10 days of life.  Can be a test of sciatic nerve damage if missing.\n\nThese reflexes can make infants appear remarkably competent and mature in their movements.  For instance, babies demonstrate early crawl like behaviors, which might surprise parents, however, these movements are not voluntary or controlled.  Instead they are reflexes which will fade away and will eventually be learned as voluntary and controlled movements at the appropriate points in development.  \n','Ethan is easily startled!',NULL,'Ethan is now almost three weeks old.  To-day his mother is changing his diaper and clothes on the table.  As she picks up his legs to powder him, Ethan suddenly startles - with eyes open very wide, mouth pursed, arms and legs shoot out and stiffen and his arms reach out in front as if to grasp something or someone.  He begins to cry.  His mother immediately picks him up and cuddles him.  With his arms and legs tucked in and his body held close to his mother’s, Ethan quickly calms down.','Ethan is demonstrating one of his many reflexes.  This is the Moro reflex.  It is a startle reflex and is a normal response to a baby’s losing his or her motor equilibrium or balance or a response to being moved abruptly from one place to another.  While all babies demonstrate this startle reflex, some may startle more than others and parents need to be more careful in handling such sensitive babies.  The startle is stressful - usually a baby cries after a startle and #his/her# color may change and even sometimes #he/she# may tremor.  But it is important to remember that this (among other reflexes) is a measure of the stability and integrity of Ethan’s central nervous system.  People speculate that this reflex is a remnant of our days as primates, when Ethan and his mother would have been fur covered.  Ethan would have been able to grasp onto his mother’s fur and cling tightly when she moved suddenly.  In modern infants, this is a normal behavior and parents usually respond by giving their baby a reassuring cuddle and this restores the baby’s equilibrium and sense of well-being. ','There are other situations when you might notice the moro reflex in #first#.  Here are some examples:\n\n? While bathing #first#, you lift #him/her# suddenly out of the bathtub, and #he/she# is startled, and begins to cry.\n\n? While leaning into the car door to put #first# into #his/her# car seat, you let go of #his/her# back and head before placing #him/her# into the seat.  #first# is startled. \n\n? You are undressing #first# to change #him/her# into #his/her# pajamas.  Even though you usually keep a hand on #first#’s belly, today you are distracted and remove both hands at once.  Immediately #first# displays the moro reflex.\n\n? Often you will notice #first# may startle while in a deep sleep.  This is typical and usually your baby will not even wake up.   You may notice #him/her# startle if there is a loud noise and again you will notice that #first# may well go back down to sleep by #him/her#self.   If the disturbing noise continues, #first# may wake up and may need you to help #him/her# settle back to sleep. \n\n? Every baby is different and in the first weeks of life, some babies are quite sensitive to external stimulation or to being moved around and will startle easily.  They need to be handled very carefully.  Prematurely born babies or small babies tend to startle more than term, full-weight babies.\n','? Every parent has to learn their baby’s threshold for responding. #first# is telling you through #his/her# behavior how sensitive #he/she# is and how #he/she# likes to be held or handled.

If you find that #first# seems to startle quite frequently, then try to contain #his/her# arms and legs more, and offer more trunk support.  \n\n? When putting #first# down on a flat surface, take a few extra minutes to maintain hand to body contact with #him/her#, so that #he/she# becomes accustomed to the new position.  Try to hold your newborn in a soft cloth baby carrier as much as is feasible to promote a high level of body contact and comfort. \n\n?

Try swaddling #him/her# tightly in a blanket. If the blanket is too small, the swaddle will be ineffective (many newborns over seven pounds are more effectively swaddled in a blanket that is nearly 45\" wide).','You can swaddle a baby from head to toe, or expose the head, neck or arms variably.  Babies who startle easily and are very sensitive to stimulation prefer to be wrapped up from “head to toe”, that is, from the shoulders to the feet.  Some parents feel uneasy about swaddling their babies to this extent but many babies need to kind of support to help them reduce excessive movements and their startles.  Again, let #first# tell you what #he/she# likes and try to gauge what is best for #him/her#.  Often a baby swaddled to encase #his/her# arms will work #his/her# arms free after a while.  Examine the type of blanket you are using to swaddle #first#.  A woven cotton blanket is more flexible and less constricting than one made of broadcloth or flannel.  Try swaddling #first# before bed after feeding #him/her# the late night feeding.  You may find that even at five months or later that #he/she# still prefers to be swaddled, and that it provides a cue to sleep.

This is important in helping infants feel secure and have a sense of control over their bodies.  Infants have many reflexes (See LW, Movement #1) and they need to be able to control these reflexes in order to focus their attention, keep quiet during feeding or to settle into sleep.\n\nHumans grow in a head to toe (cephalocaudal) order.  Therefore, development of muscular control follows the same pattern (Leach, 1976). The ability to support the head is an infants first major physical accomplishment (Fong & Resnick, 1980).  It is during the first three months that infants discover that all their body parts are attached and under their control (Leach, 1976).  \n\nAccording to Weisenfreund (1995), infants earliest experiences are active and body based.  Each coordinated movement made by the infant requires flexion or extension and in some instances both.  A newborn is not capable of this.  At birth, motor behavior is characterized by whole body movement.  Physiological flexion is also present.  This is a curled, flexed position which develops in utero during the last trimester of pregnancy.  It is considered to be a normal muscular state and the baseline for further motor development.  The first week of life is marked by rapid development of extensor tone.  This makes controlled and organized movements more possible.  During early infancy primitive reflexes which existed prior to birth are gradually integrated into more complex and voluntary movement patterns (Weisenfreund, 1995).\n\nNewborns often look to their parents for help in enabling them to feel secure and control their bodies, particularly at times when infants arms flail around and legs become taut or they are hungry or stressed.  Parents often help by cuddling the infant or swaddling them in blankets.  Weisenfreund (1995) suggests that this cuddling provides a greater opportunity for the infant who \"...may achieve greater balance and muscle tone, smoother movements, [and] better integration of vestibular responses...\" (p. 48).\n\nResearch on children\'s motor development has received less attention than other forms of development in previous years.  However, more recently, there is increased interest in the topic and particularly in the self organizing nature of developmental change (Thelen, 1995).\n','Carrie is nursing well.',NULL,'When she was first born, Carrie was having trouble latching on to her mothers breast properly.  With persistence, Carrie is now able to turn her face towards the breast, open her mouth, flatten her tongue over her lower gums, and use it to hold the nipple in her mouth while extracting milk at the same time. ','Carrie has some amazing motor capacities even as a newborn.  Not only does she have  inborn reflexes - such as the hand grasp or the stepping reflex - but she is even able to combine some of her reflexes, and #he/she# can make them work for #him/her#.  For example, her rooting reflex (which is set off by stroking her cheek beside her lips), combines with her head turning reflex (called the Tonic Neck Reflex) and the sucking reflex, to enable her to find the breast and latch on.  In other words, she can coordinate several actions smoothly (latching on to the breast, positioning it in her mouth), and moving her jaws rhythmically to force the milk into her mouth.','You may notice some other examples of #first#’s efforts to control #his/her# motor behavior.

Prior to this, infants\' heads drop forward if they are unsupported and therefore it\'s important to provide babies with proper neck support when lifting them.  Even as babies develop greater control and stronger neck muscles, it\'s important to provide such support.  In the first month, children begin to develop stronger neck muscles and demonstrate this by turning their heads and lifting their chins up (Hetherington & Parke, 1984).  According to researcher, David Gallahue (1982) who studies children\'s motor development, at birth, children are able to turn to one side, by one week old, they can turn their heads to both sides, and by the end of the first month, they can hold their heads and necks with support at the base of the neck.  By the end of the second month, they are able to lift their chins from the surface of contact (Gallahue, 1982).  By 3 months of age, infants are able to lift their heads and chests when in a prone position (Gallahue, 1982) and support themselves on their arms for about 10 seconds (Fischer & Lazerson, 1984).

They tend to do this when they get excited, as more complex neurological behavior is not available to express their excitement (Thelen, 1981).  While the movements are not reflexes, they aren\'t entirely voluntary either (Sroufe, DeHart & Cooper, 1992).  Another form of leg movement that is common is a repetitive kicking pattern.  Babies\' movements often progress from jerky less controlled motions to smother controlled ones (Thelen, 1981).  For example, infants learn they can alter leg movements by stopping and starting or changing the rhythm of their kicking.  They also discover that kicking both legs is an effective way to rid themselves of covers or make their carriage bounce (Leach 1976)!  Research suggests that since babies don\'t learn voluntary, controlled movements until after these repetitive patterns have disappeared, it may be that these are an important step between reflexes and voluntary motor control (Rovee Collier & Gekoski, 1979).  Research also indicates that kicking movements increase just before the beginning of locomotion (Thelen, 1981).','Adelaide seems to kick like a frog on her stomach or on her back.',NULL,'Francis is watching his daughter Adelaide as she wakes up.

Some babies have, by temperament, low arousal levels, while others are quiet because they take longer to recover from a difficult labor and delivery or may have been placed under the (bilirubin) lights, so that this is still a recovery period for them.  The fact is that some babies need more sleep than others but they may also need you to help them become more aroused.  They also need to be able to look around and explore their new environment.

Once they are gaining control over their heads and necks, they begin to gain control of their body trunks (lumbar and thoracic).  When lying on their stomachs, two month olds are usually able to lift their chests up from the surface that they are on.  According to Gallahue (1982), once infants can do this, they can begin to pull their knees up towards their chest. this happens by around 6 months of age. Control of trunk muscles also means that infants are a gaining the ability to roll over from their backs to their stomachs.  Rolling from a prone to a supine position is harder and occurs later (Gallahue, 1982).  Development proceeds proximal-distally (inside to outside) and cephalocaudally (head to toe).  So gaining control over head then trunk and trunk then extremities fits with this pattern.','Donnie can partially support his weight on his arms.',NULL,'Donnie is lying next to his father Xavier on a firm bed.

Reflexes tend to appear and disappear in a fairly regular sequence and schedule of development. Around two months of age, children tend to show two new reflexes, the Labrinthine Righting Reflex and the Neck and Body Righting Reflex. In the Labyrinthine Righting Reflex, when infants are held upright and tilted slightly side to side or front to back, they respond by trying to keep their heads upright.  Research shows that even when a baby can\'t rely upon it\'s other sense (sight, sound, touch), this reflex helps infants keep their heads straight (Twitchell, 1965). This reflex strengthens by around 6 months of age (Fiorentino, 1963) and helps babies in learning to keep their heads up and to achieve balance.  The Neck and Body Righting Reflexes are a set of reflexes that also appear at about two months of age.  If infants are placed on their stomachs, with their heads turned to one side, they reflexively move their bodies to the same direction.  From their sides, they move their heads to be aligned with their bodies (Gallahue, 1982; Twitchell, 1965).  This reflex lasts until about 6 months (Fiorentino, 1963) and according to Gallahue (1982) forms the basis for a baby\'s voluntary rolling later.  Around three months of age, children begin to demonstrate the Pull-up Reflex. When infants are in an upright position, if you hold one or both hands, they will attempt an upright position when tipped forwards or backwards.  This reflex is not present from birth .  It appears at around 3-4 months and continues until about 1 year old (Gallahue, 1982).','Casey holds her head upright when her body is sideways.',NULL,'Casey has been a bit colicky.

When Beth rotates Casey’s body to answer the phone, Casey moves her head relative to the plane of her body.','Casey is demonstrating some of the new motor behaviors that seem to build on some of her early newborn reflexes, in this case, the Tonic Neck Reflex.  She is keeping her head upright and balanced, and also tries to move her body to match the position of her head.

This will soon help Casey in learning to roll over, as she reflexively tries to keep her head in line with her body.','Here are a few other examples of how #first# may demonstrate these new behavior patterns:\n\n?

The increase in control of the body trunk and muscle strength contributes to infants\' ability to do so. This is helped by a set of reflexes that appear at around 2 months of age, the Neck and Body Righting Reflexes. [See Learning Window, Movement 2 Months: Demonstrating New Reflexes] If infants are placed on their stomachs, with their heads turned to one side, they reflexively move their bodies to the same direction.  From their sides, they move their heads to be aligned with their bodies (Gallahue, 1982; Twitchell, 1965).  This reflex lasts until about 6 months (Fiorentino, 1963) and according to Gallahue (1982) forms the basis for a baby\'s voluntary rolling later.  \n\n \nRolling has great significance for an infant.  Through rolling, infants can make themselves more comfortable, change their view of the world, and increase their freedom to move around.  It is important to place infants on smooth, firm surfaces and keep them free of wrappings to allow for practice of rolling.  With the onset of rolling parents need to be aware of some possible dangers.  Infants may roll into the side of the crib or roll off of a bed or sofa.  Also, infants may catch their arm under their body in the process of rolling (Leach 1976).   Since many parents are putting their babies to bed on their side or back as a result of warnings about SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome), it\'s becoming common for babies to master the more complex back to front roll before the seemingly simpler front to back roll. \n','Rolling in One Direction  ','Development of Trunk Muscles','For just a few minutes, David left his daughter Ellen on a king  sized bed after giving her a bath.

However, around 3 months of age (and typically within the range of  3-7 months), children suppress the grasp reflex and are purposefully able to grasp objects that are put in their hands.  They use a whole hand grasp.  They do not yet use their thumbs as opposable or pick up small objects using just a few fingers as in a pincer grasp.   By now, infants can scratch with their fingers on tabletops, look at and swipe at objects, and hold onto a toy placed in his or her hand.   While infants can maintain a grasp, they still have difficulty voluntarily letting go of objects.  It is not until they are about six months old that they can begin to do so (Sroufe, DeHart, & Cooper, 1992) and even then, their ability is a bit crude.   \n\nBy 20 weeks of age, children begin to make contact with objects and to grasp them precariously.  They are moving beyond swiping and are exercising their increasingly coordinated visual and reaching skills and can demonstrate it through a precarious grasp of the object that they reach out for. They don\'t necessarily have a full grasp of it nor do they use their entire palm, though this ability develops in the coming weeks.  When they were younger, at around three months, they could hold onto an object put into their hands and could swipe at objects of interest.  Now, they bring the two skills together.  \n\nBy five months, infants become more adept at grasping and maintaining objects, they begin to use their whole hand to more securely grasp objects and lift objects by pushing the objects with their fingers against their palms. Then they can use their palms to help them more securely grasp an object.  As they get just a bit older, they being to use a whole hand or mitten grasp.  This occurs around six months and means that they use their thumb separately as in using a mitten but not yet as opposable.  Around 7 months old, children often tend to use a scissors grasp where they pick up small objects by using a scissor motion with their hand and thumbs.  The opposable use of the thumb tends to occur around 8 months of age, however, while children are then able to use the thumb as opposite their fingers, typically, they use their fingers as a unit so the object is grasped between them. By around nine and ten months of age, children begin to use an index finger approach which relies upon using the index finger to contact the object and then using the thumb as opposable to it.  By around one year old, children begin to use their thumbs opposite just one finger in a coordinated effort where both thumb and finger meet in the middle enabling a neat pincer grasp.\n','Carter holds onto the teething ring!',NULL,'Although there are not yet any signs of teeth, Carter has been drooling excessively and chewing on his hands and everyone else’s knuckles when they get near his mouth.

Initially, babies accidentally touch an object through spontaneous arm waving.  The beginning attempts at swiping, which follow, are often crude and inaccurate (Cratty, 1979).  These are early steps in visually directed reaching and as infants become increasingly adept at coordinating their eyes and hands, they become more adept at reaching out to grab the object that they want [See Related LWS VS, Movement, etc.]. Swiping is a swift motion and is characterized by reaching with a closed fist which opens as the object is contacted.  This movement is not corrective (Michel, 1991).  Swiping requires an extraordinary number of different neurological impulses.  Babies need to see the object and connect it with his or her own hand.  Learning to swipe also teaches babies cause and effect as they bat at a toy and then watch as it bounces and swings.  Babies progress to swiping in their own individual ways and at different rates of development.  However, once swiping behavior is exhibited, providing babies with objects to swipe at should accelerate the development of further reaching (Bower, 1974).\n\nAround 4 months of age, infants become increasingly able to coordinate their looking and their physical reach.  By now, children are often learning to successfully coordinate vision and reaching so that they can make contact with the objects that they see.  This makes it possible for them to see something and visually guide their reach to get it.  Infants have usually achieved reliable visually-directed contact by the time that they are about 5 and 1/2 months old.\n','Marguerite is starting to reach for everything.',NULL,'Pierre is holding his daughter, Marguerite, while trying to read the newspaper.

Gallahue defines three stages along the way to independent sitting (Gallahue, 1982).  At three to four months of age, youngsters can sit with the support of an adult holding the lumbar (lower back) area and they need a wide base of support.  They are more successful at controlling their upper bodies than their lower bodies so lumbar support is especially important.  By six or seven months of age, they are able to sit alone, but they often lean forward in an exaggerated manner.  It is not uncommon for them to use their hands to support themselves (Fischer & Lazerson, 1984).  Increasingly during the seventh month, infants are able to hold their trunk up without using their arms for support for short periods of time (Fong & Resnick, 1980).  By eight months of age, youngsters are often able to sit with alone with good control of their lower backs (lumbar region).  A narrower base of support is possible and they tend to sit with a straighter back that allows for greater balance.  At about eleven months the youngster will be able to sit and pivot (Bremmer 1988).','Willis sits on his fathers lap.',NULL,'Willis and his father Len are waiting to see the pediatrician.

At three months of age, they may have been seen swiping at objects (and in rare cases as early as 2 months old).  At 4 months of age, children are often learning to successfully coordinate vision and reaching so that they can make contact with the objects that they see.   This makes it possible for them to see something and visually guide their reach to get it.  Infants have usually achieved reliable visually-directed contact by the time that they are about 5 and 1/2 months old.  \n\nThe environment plays an important role in visually-directed reaching (White &Heid, 1966).  Researchers compared the onset of visually-directed reaching in institutionalized babies in two conditions, youngsters who were provided with \"enriched visual environments\" (including colorful things to look at such as mobiles and baby bumpers) and other youngsters who did not have enriched visual environments (simply the environment in the institution which tended to be plain and visually replete.)  The babies in the enriched condition learned visually-directed reaching in half the time as those with the replete environments (45 days as compared to 98 days).  However, a balance of stimulation and the right timing are important.  Infants who were given too much visual stimulation before they were at a point where swiping and other prehensatory behaviors were evident showed less interest in the stimuli, cried more, and may have been over-stimulated (White & Heid, 1966).

They are moving beyond swiping and are exercising their increasingly coordinated visual and reaching skills and can demonstrate it through a precarious grasp of the object that they reach out for. They don\'t necessarily have a full grasp of it nor do they use their entire palm, though this ability develops in the coming weeks.  When they were younger, at around three months, they could hold onto an object put into their hands and could swipe at objects of interest.  Now, they bring the two skills together.  \n\n \nBy five months, infants become more adept at grasping and maintaining objects, they begin to use their whole hand to more securely grasp objects and lift objects by pushing the objects with their fingers against their palms. Then they can use their palms to help them more securely grasp an object.  As they get just a bit older, they being to use a whole hand or mitten grasp.  This occurs around six months and means that they use their thumb separately as in using a mitten but not yet as opposable.  Around 7 months old, children often tend to use a scissors grasp where they pick up small objects by using a scissor motion with their hand and thumbs.  The opposable use of the thumb tends to occur around 8 months of age, however, while children are then able to use the thumb as opposite their fingers, typically, they use their fingers as a unit so the object is grasped between them. By around nine and ten months of age, children begin to use an index finger approach which relies upon using the index finger to contact the object and then using the thumb as opposable to it.  By around one year old, children begin to use their thumbs opposite just one finger in a coordinated effort where both thumb and finger meet in the middle enabling a neat pincer grasp.\n\nPicking object up is one feat, another is voluntarily letting objects go.  Infants become increasingly able to voluntarily release objects between the ages of 6 and 8 months of age.  While their release is still somewhat crude, it develops further in the coming months, particularly as they begin dropping experiments with their toys.

At this age, frequent movements of one hand over the other occur in response to visual stimulation.  However, the age in which hand preference is firmly established has not been definitively determined (Rice, Plomin, & DeFries, 1984; Michel, 1991).  \n\nThe preferred head orientation of newborns can be an indicator of right or left hand-use.  Between four and eighteen months of age, consistent hand preference is seen in reaching activities.  Around ten or eleven months, infants will hold toys in their preferred hand.  Also, the preferred hand will be more successful in reaching activities than the other hand. (Michel, 1991).\n\nThe emergence of laterality relates to the suppression of the Tonic Neck Reflex.  When you place an infant on his or her back and turn his or her head to one side, the tonic neck reflex causes him or her to go into a \'\'fencing\'\' position, with the arm on that side extended, the knee on that side flexed and the opposite arm crooked. Babies gradually learn to overcome the Tonic Neck Reflex which typically disappears by about 4 months of age.  As babies overcome the tonic neck reflex, they can  use each side of their bodies separately and watch and use their hands voluntarily. \n\nDuring the preschool years, the left and right hemisphere of the brain become more specialized and hand preference becomes more established.  The left hemisphere is the center of control for speech and control of the right hand (          ).  It is believed that the development of hand preference is closely related to the development of language.  Maturation of the left hemisphere may be slower than the right hemisphere in boys while the opposite is true of girls (Shucard & Shucard, 1990).  This may explain why boys have a slightly greater tendency to show left hand preference and ambidexterity than girls (Smart & Smart, 1977).\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:29:58','2012-08-22 12:29:58'),(2563,'mv_5_1','Early Attempts at \"Standing\" with  Support','According to researcher, David Gallahue (1982) as early as five months of age, infants will attempt to stand if they are held under the armpits such that their feet are brought into contact with a surface for standing on.

By this age, infants perceive that leaning extends their effective reaching space (McKenzie, Skouteris, Day,  Hartman,  & Yonas, 1993).  Soon infants begin to do more than reaching for objects.  When they lunge for toys, they are setting the stage for crawling as they fall forward onto their hands and knees.  A  precursor to crawling develops from a front lying position.  The upper body is lifted and propped on the forearms while shoulders and elbows are flexed at right angles.  The infant\'s gaze is fixed ahead (Peiper, 1963).  The first attempts often occur when infants reach with both arms for an object that is just out of reach.  As a result they fail to get the object and fall forward (Cratty, 1979).  As a result, the infant props his/her arms up again and pulls his/her body up moving a short distance (Peiper, 1963).  Another precursor to crawling is pushing up on hands and knees to rock back and forth or make bridge.  Another is to use the arms to pull along the floor, and the toes or knees to push (without getting  into a crawling position). (Goldfield, 1989)  Other precursors include hitching (balancing on crown of head and feet with neck and back arched), rolling [see Rolling in One Direction] and swimming [see Demonstrating a Repertoire of Reflexes] (Shirley, 1931). There are an endless variety of both positions and the development of locomotion in babies. This motor development makes it possible for infants to begin to explore their environments more thoroughly. \n\nEarly crawling attempts are often clumsy, requiring great effort, and only allowing infants to cover small distances.  For these reasons, infants usually don\'t persevere at trying to move this way.  Some infants may quickly move to more efficient forms of movement (or skip over these early forms altogether (Peiper, 1963)) that involve getting the trunk of their bodies off the ground and using their limbs in opposition to each other [See Movement LW- Creeping- The 9 Month Old].\n\n \nBabies not only develop proximodistally (inside to outside but cephalocaudally (head to toe).   This means that they control their upper bodies before their lower bodies, and they must synthesize these movements before they can begin to crawl.  Babies may skip one or even all forms of early locomotion.  Some babies gain strength simultaneously in their hips, legs, arms and shoulders, rather than developing upper body strength first, and so are likely to focus on cruising and walking instead.  \n\nThe role of practice has been controversial in the onset of improved motor skills.  A classic study of Navajo babies who were strapped to cradle boards throughout most of their infancy found there was no delay in walking (Dennis, & Dennis, 1940).  Babies who were offered three minutes of practice in locomotion per day beginning at two weeks old did walk two months earlier than their counterparts who did not have practice (Zelazo, Zelazo, & Kolb, 1972).  The African Kipsigis encourage and early sitting (by placing the baby in a shallow hole in the earth), standing, and walking, which results in earlier locomotor onset (Super, 1976), but only in those skills practiced.  On the other hand, babies who are not given the special practice soon catch up to their trained counterparts.\n','Marc gets to a toy out of his reach!',NULL,'Marc has mastered sitting over the past few months.  His father, Artie has put a few soft toys just out of Marc’s reach.  Marc leans forward towards the toys, and nearly reaches one.  He leans even more and finally topples forward onto his outstretched arms and knees (standard crawling position).  Marc still cannot reach the toys, so he reaches forward with one arm, while balancing on his two knees and one arm.  Success at last   Marc grabs one of the toys.','Marc is exhibiting an early form of crawling.  Over time, Marc will develop his own style of getting around (the typical crawling style, scootching, charging on all fours, or even sitting up on his bottom and pulling his legs toward his bottom to get where he wants to go).

Now, they are able to support their weight to a certain extent with their legs for a short period of time.  They still need to be able to lean quite heavily on a stable object to maintain their balance and to support some of the weight.  As early as five months of age, infants will attempt to stand if they are held under the armpits such that their feet are brought into contact with a surface for standing on.  Babies attempt to straighten out their legs, tensing the muscles and maintaining a standing position.  This doesn\'t mean that they are able to support their weight on their legs.  By around 9 to 10 months of age, infants can stand up while holding onto objects and usually are able to pull themselves up into a standing position by this time [See related Learning Window, Movement, 8 Months, #1 Pulls self to stand]  By one year of age, children can usually stand independently of support.','Mitzi bears most of her weight on her legs.',NULL,'Mitzi has always liked to look at and interact with the world from a standing position.

By around one year old, children begin to use their thumbs opposite just one finger in a coordinated effort where both thumb and finger meet in the middle enabling a neat pincer grasp.\n\nAs newborns, their grasp was reflexive.  Around three months they began to gain more voluntary control over it.  They could hold onto an object put into their hands and around four months, they could precariously grasp an object.  Now, they are able to use their palms to help them more securely grasp an object.  By five months, they were becoming more adept at grasping and maintaining objects, they begin to use their whole hand to more securely grasp objects and lift objects by pushing the objects with their fingers against their palms.  Around six months of age, children begin to use a whole hand or mitten grasp.  This means that they use their thumb separately as in using a mitten but not yet as opposable.  Around 7 months old, children often tend to use a scissors grasp where they pick up small objects by using a scissor motion with their hand and thumbs.\n  \nPicking object up is one feat, another is voluntarily letting objects go.  Infants become increasingly able to voluntarily release objects between the ages of 6 and 8 months of age.

Eight children were observed longitudinally when bouncing while supported by a harness attached to a spring.  The mean age of infants at which they exhibited the longest string of successive bounces was (8 mos.) 244 days.  Learning to bounce was not immediate and required a lot of experience in the harness.  Infants in the harness were able to make it bounce by pushing their feet against the floor.  Infants went through an initial phase, in which kicking was irregular and variable in period.  During this phase infants were exploring how the harness worked.  The next phase, a tuning phase is characterized by more periodic kicking during which infants adjusted their leg stiffness to match the harness spring stiffness.  This was followed by the sudden appearance of long bouts of sustained bouncing (Goldfield, Kay, & Warren, 1993).  Researchers consider infant interest in bouncing to be significant because it shows infants at this age are motivated by a task (Thelen, 1995).','B.J. bounces on his feet.',NULL,'B.J. is visiting his uncle John’s house.

However, other developmentalists (Cratty, 1979) have used the term, \"creeping\" to refer to the earlier crawling efforts when children drag their bodies along the floor, creating some confusion about what the label means.  Here, creeping refers to the more advanced form of crawling and is defined as moving with the trunk off the ground, using the both the hands and feet.  Creeping tends to be a very efficient means of locomotion.   Crawling refers to dragging the body along the floor using arm and leg movements (Zaichowsky et al., 1980).  Once children have mastered crawling, it evolves into creeping as they develop a stationary knee, extended arm posture.  Then they learn to move one limb at a time (Gallahue, 1982; Zaichowsky et al., 1980).  This progresses to using the arms and legs in opposition to each other (Gallahue, 1982).  A very efficient form of creeping is to use the right arm, left leg together/left arm, right leg together in a contralateral pattern.  Approximately 80% of creepers use this pattern.  About 20% of infants use a right arm, right leg together/left arm, left leg together in a homolateral pattern (Cratty, 1979).  \n\nBabies not only develop proximodistally (inside to outside but cephalocaudally (head to toe).   This means that they control their upper bodies before their lower bodies, and they must synthesize all their movements at once before they move around on their own. Babies may skip crawling and related forms of locomotion.  While doctors used to be concerned about this and thought that lack of crawling was connected to perceptual problems (Delacato, 1966), most doctors today believe that babies sometimes skip this step because they have gained strength simultaneously in their hips, legs, arms and shoulders, rather than developing upper body strength first, and so are likely to focus on cruising and walking instead. \n','Julie crawls from room to room.',NULL,'Julie’s mother Jackie has been busy preparing for a house full of guests who are coming at the weekend.

Cruising is when children pull themselves up on the furniture or other environmental supports and use it to help them move around.  They hold onto the furniture and use it to provide balance and to guide them.  Typically, between the ages of  7-13 months of age, children tend to cruise around using the furniture to support them.  Even though children\'s legs are typically strong enough to support them, they need the handholds to provide balance. Cruising enables children to coordinate mastering the ability to control their bodies in a standing position with the dynamic, postural shifts that are needed in order to walk in a manner that is safe and offers supports.  Cruising also enables children to discover the delights of the greater independence and efficiency that an upright gait affords them.  It\'s not long before they seek to extend their cruising space beyond the limits of where the furniture and the hands of adults and older children enable them to go, and take their first tentative independent steps. \n\nChildren go through a number of stages before they master mature walking (Gallahue, 1982; Shirley, 1931).  As children\'s walking matures, the speed and the length of the step increases, the feet start to turn inward until they are pointing straight ahead, the distance between the feet widens and once children grow more comfortable, decreases a little, and eventually their gait becomes smoother and their movements achieve a greater synchrony (Gallahue, 1982). \n','Maurice moves around the room holding onto the furniture.',NULL,'Maurice has been able to pull himself to a standing position against the sofa for a few weeks now.

A child\'s earliest steps can be quite awkward, hesitant, and irregular.  Children tend to spread their base of support walking with their knees turned slightly outward.  Children\'s arm movements are not yet in synchrony with what their feet are doing (Gallahue, 1982).  \n\nResearchers have long been interested in what influences when a child starts to walk.  The fact that the motor reflexes exist at birth has intrigued researchers and so they have studied whether this reflex leads to or appears to evolve into later stepping activity.  Even if the reflex exists, the infant needs to bring it under voluntary control in being able to walk.  Research by Ester Thelen shows that while the reflex tends to decrease at about 2 months of age, if babies exercise it, it persists and can be seen in 7 month olds (1986).  This isn\'t enough for a baby to walk, however.  In order to walk, the infants\' legs must support their weight, they need to have balance, and they need to control the reflex.  Beyond this, they need to integrate all of these movements (Thelen, 1986).\n\nThe role of practice has been controversial in the onset of improved motor skills.  A classic study of Navajo babies who were strapped to cradle boards throughout most of their infancy found there was no delay in walking (Dennis, & Dennis, 1940).  Babies who were offered three minutes of practice in locomotion per day beginning at two weeks old did walk two months earlier than their counterparts who did not have practice (Zelazo, Zelazo, & Kolb, 1972).  The African Kipsigis encourage and early sitting (by placing the baby in a shallow hole in the earth), standing, and walking, which results in earlier locomotor onset (Super, 1976), but only in those skills practiced.  On the other hand, babies who are not given the special practice soon catch up to their trained counterparts.\n','Aaron takes his first steps alone.',NULL,'Aaron has been able to pull himself up against furniture for some time now.

The stimulation of the nervous system could be social or it could be physiological. Too much social stimulation (touching, patting, attempts to communicate) or physiological stimulation (such as cold, hunger, pain, and so on) can lead to crying.  While babies are preadapted in ways that assist their survival, their early cries are not really viewed as intentional by developmentalists as much as they are viewed as adaptive.  The baby isn\'t crying \"in order to get his or her way.\"  However, the crying serves a purpose when caregivers interpret it in certain ways.  In this sense, early crying can be viewed as a precursor to social crying.  When the contingencies in the baby\'s environment are such that they learn that crying draws certain responses, babies begin to develop a \"goodness of fit\" with their caretakers and their actions work within that system of regulation to have \"a social intent\" (e.g. Tronick, 1980; Tronick, Cohn & Shea, 1986; Tronick, Als, & Brazelton, 1980).  Developmentalists point out that the difference between the infant\'s early adaptive cry and intentional crying is subtle but important.  The infant \"needs\" caregivers who interpret the cries as forms of communication in order for the cries to be adaptive and to enable the baby and parents to develop a \"goodness of fit.\" (e.g. Newson, 1974; Sroufe, Cooper, & DeHart, 1992, Stern, 1977).','\"Crying elicits a response\"',NULL,'Shortly after Nainoa\'s feeding, he begins fussing in his bassinet.

Your baby’s cry was probably the first sound you heard from #him/her#! Nainoa is crying may be in response to being exposed to the cold air. However, he is not crying because he “knows” his cries will elicit a response from his mother. His early cries, like your baby’s early cries, are adaptive, meaning that when you hear your newborn cry, you most likely will respond and attempt to figure out why your baby is crying. Thus, your important job is to learn how to interpret your baby’s cries so that you can respond quickly and appropriately. Nainoa’s mother, seeing that he is no longer swaddled in the blanket, interprets his cry as meaning, “I’m cold”, so she immediately swaddles him snugly. Your baby’s cries may also be a response to overstimulation, which can be both social, such as being patted too much, or physical, such as being cold or hungry. Your quick and appropriate responding to these kinds of overstimulation will help your baby stay calm and help you and your baby develop a good interaction style.

This has been referred to as the \"newborn sleep smile.\"  The corners of the infant\'s mouth turn up slightly while the baby\'s eyes remain uncrinkled.  The smile is actually due to internal factors rather than external ones.  It has been referred to as reflexive or endogenous by researchers (Emde, Gaensbauer, & Harmon, 1976), so in a strict sense it is not social in origin. However, while the newborn sleep smile doesn\'t have a social intent or signal pleasure, the fact that parents tend to interpret it that way makes it adaptive and an important facilitator of the parent-child social interactions to come.   The research of Emde (1985) shows that many parents attribute different emotions to such expressions and that these in turn facilitate interaction.  Research shows that the newborn smile is due to spontaneous discharge in the lower brain regions and that they don\'t really indicate pleasure (Emde, Gaensbauer, & Harmon, 1976). The smiles occurs most often when babies are sleeping and most often in the REM (Rapid Eye Movement) state of sleep considered to tbe the dreamins tate of sleep.  They also occur during drowsiness (Stern, 1977).  Sleep smiles occur more often in babies who are born prematurely or are born without a cerebral cortex than in other babies and they disappear as the cortex matures (Sroufe, Cooper, & DeHart, 1992.  The smiles vary in length from fleeting to prolonged (Stern, 1977).  \n\nResearchers believe that the smile results from a slight rise and then a slight drop above and below a critical arousal threshold and that this causes the face muscles to relax into a smile.  According to Sroufe and colleagues (Sroufe, Cooper, & DeHart, 1992; Sroufe & Waters, 1976), if you gently shake a rattle when a newborn is sleeping, about 5 to 7 seconds later, a lightly sleeping infant will smile.  If a sleeping newborn is startled, it will take some time before the threshold arousal level is again reached and so the baby will not smile for a while.\n','\"The newborn smile\"',NULL,'Tamar\'s parents peek into her bassinet to reassure themselves that their daughter, who was born prematurely, is sleeping soundly.

She must be having a good dream, her parents think, as they quietly leave the room.','What Tamar’s parents are interpreting as a smile is not yet a social smile. So why did the corners of Tamar’s mouth turn up a little when her mother bumped into the mobile? Tamar’s “smile” is actually an arousal response to the sounds of the mobile. When your newborn is slightly aroused, not too much or too little, #his/her# face muscles will relax into a smile. Had the sound been very intense, Tamar’s parents would have seen her startle rather than smile. Even if the expression your baby is making is an arousal response, you probably delight in seeing your baby’s smile. You are developing an attachment with your baby that is the precursor to future interactions when your baby’s smile is truly social.','?

While busy, sleepless parents may feel that they are doing much of the adjusting, research shows that infants are learning a lot about the patterns in their world and are adjusting  to those rhythms.  Research shows that parents and children are often well on their way towards such coordinated interactions in the earliest weeks of life.  Children have been shown to adjust to certain patterns of caregiving, while parents have been shown to adjust to patterns such as children\'s sucking patterns (Kaye, 1982; Kaye & Wells, 1980).  Researchers have studied the patterns of babies\' sucking and their mothers\' gently jiggling them.  They found a subtle type of turn-taking that is well-established from only a few days after birth.  Looking at the pattern in depth, Kenneth Kaye and colleagues found that while the pattern starts with babies\' natural sucking patterns (Wolff, 1966) (what infants would do even if they weren\'t being held and jiggled), mothers respond to this pattern in how and when they jiggle, and that babies increasingly adapt to the patterns.  They didn\'t start as often sucking while being jiggled and they started soon after the jiggling stopped (Kaye, 1982; Kaye & Wells, 1980).  In another study (Sander, 1975), two nurses with different caregiving styles and the babies in their care were followed.  In a mere ten days, babies adapted to the style of the nurse who cared for them and disruptions to those patterns resulted in eating and sleeping disruptions.  Attachment is a process that results from repeated interactions (Sroufe, Cooper, & DeHart, 1991) and develops over time.  Even though children do not demonstrate specific attachments through their behaviors yet [See Related Social LW-7 Months- Specific Attachments], they certainly are adapting to and seeking synchrony in their interactive patterns with their parents.','\"Seeking out synchrony\"',NULL,'Noticing that he is very alert and attentive, Jason\'s mother gently bounces him up and down.

His mother notices him beginning to fuss and she immediately attempts to soothe him, holding him steady and allowing him to quiet down. She waits until the next time he is attentive and interested before she plays with him again.','Jason’s mother is doing what seems to come naturally to many parents. She is adjusting the way she interacts with Jason based on his behavior. When Jason’s behavior indicates he is not enjoying her jiggling, she stops jiggling him.  Jason is also coordinating his behavior with that of his mother, responding with coos of delight following her jiggling.  Just as Jason and his mother are developing a synchronous relationship when they adjust their behavior to one another, so too do you and your baby when you coordinate your behaviors to reach a level of synchrony. A synchronous relationship takes time to develop, so you may have to be patient as your baby works to figure out the patterns around #him/her#.  You are in the process of building an attachment relationship that comes through repeatedly interacting with your baby, allowing time for both of you to adjust to each other’s rhythms.','? As the weeks go by #first# is becoming accustomed to the patterns, rhythms and cadences of your voice.   #he/she# already recognises and seems to “know” your voice and prefers it to anything else.\n\n?

These moments may be fleeting - but the effects on #first#’s social development are long-lasting.\n\n? Whether it is around feeding or diapering, consoling and conversing with #first#, remember that this is the prototype of all #first#’s future social interactions in life!  In these simple conversations with you, #first# is already learning that this is how people communicate.  Not that #first# actually thinks this through in any cognitive way.

It is never a “perfect dance” as parents and their babies are only beginning to learn to interact with each other at this time.

When there is a match in expectation and style between the partners in any interaction it is more likely the interaction will be a success.  Synchronicity depends of what both partners bring to the interaction and every successful interaction is a two-way process.  For infants and their partners at this time, this is work.  Synchronicity only comes about through hard work, although when you hear these beautiful coos and see those first smiles, this work is undeniably one of the most exquisite joys we will ever experiences in our lives.\n','?

While much of it will “come natural” to you, you and #first# have to write your own script!  Try to discover what makes #first# who #he/she# is and how #he/she# wants to be responded to.    #he/she# has #his/her# own disposition and style of interaction and the only way to learn to interact with #him/her# is by getting to know that style and disposition intimately.    \n\n? Finding each other’s rhythms is the key task for parents and babies at this time.  Trying to find a match or a rhythm between your styles is essential.

If #first# is “laid back’ and more out-going or social, then you respond to #him/her# in a way that engages #him/her#.  It is the match that is essential.\n\n? For parents, it means recognising that the baby is a partner in the interaction and that for it to be successful, you cannot dictate the pace or pattern of the interaction.  It can never be one way.  This maxim also dictates that you have to be senstive not only the the timing of your interactions together but to the time of the interactions. #first# may not be ready when you are.  You must wait until #he/she# is ready for you.  #his/her# “quality time” may not be yours, so that you have to be patient! \n\n? The key to successful interaction with #first# is learning to identify #his/her# threshold for responding.  This means, learning to know when #first# is ready to respond, to recognise signs of readiness and availability for interaction and to be able to recognise the moment when #first# is being overstimulated.  It can be a subtle sign - a change of color revealing stress, a fuss, averting #his/her# gaze away from you, tremors revealing stimulation overload, tensing of muscle tone.

Some researchers believe that this response signals the roots of early empathy (Martin & Clark, 1987; Hoffman, 1977).  Others think that the child may  merely confuse the other baby\'s crying with his or her own (Eisenberg, 1992).  In either case, researchers agree that the capacity to respond to another\'s distress in this way may be an early precursor of later empathic abilities (Eisenberg, 1989). This crying response to other infants crying often leads to what has been called \"contagion crying\" where a whole nursery of children begin to cry in response to one child\'s cries!  Interestingly, babies do not start crying if they hear nonaffective sounds that have similar acoustic parameters to infant crying (Sagi & Hoffman, 1976; Simner, 1971; Thompson, 1987).\n\n \nBy six months of age, infants no longer cry when another child cries, but about half the time, they express interest in the other baby\'s crying (Hay, Nash, & Pedersen, 1981).  According to Nancy Eisenberg (1992), it is not clear whether children do this because they are concerned for the other infant or merely because they are curious.   By 10-11 months, children again become upset when another child is upset [See Related Social LW#2, 10-11 Months, Responding to the Distress of Others].  It appears that the upset of the peer causes real upset for the observing child more than to be an empathetic response.  At around 18 months of age (Zahn-Waxler & Radke-Yarrow, 1984), there is an increase in behaviors such as touching, patting, or doing something to amuse them an upset child [See Related Social LW #3, 18-20 Months- Increased Frequency of Empathetic Responses to Others].  Such behaviors continue to increase in frequency between two and three years old and by three children are growing better able to take the perspective of others and are growing more responsive to others (Dunn, 1988), thought they are still not commonplace (Eisenberg, 1992).  For an excellent in-depth review on this topic, the reader is referred to Eisenberg (1992). \n','\"Crying in response to another infant\'s crying\"',NULL,'Maria\'s parents bring her to the pediatrician\'s office for her one-month check-up.

Parents have used a range of remedies, all of which work at least some of the time: swaddling, placing the baby in a swing, riding in the car, massaging the baby’s belly, camamomile tea or other remedies to settle #his/her# stomach, a pacifier. ','This kind of excessive crying tends to end by three months.  If #first# is colicky, then it is a long time to wait.  The sleepless nights of getting up and trying to console #first# will surely take their toll on you and your partner.  Some parents feel very guilty at the anger and frustration they feel towards their infants.  If you feel like that, rest assured that almost all parents of colicky babies feel this way.  This is the norm for parents of colicky babies.   Fortunately, it is a short-lived experience and it does not make you a bad parent nor does it make #first# a bad baby. ','Dealing with stress is a challenge for every baby.  Sometimes, the one-month-old baby can console #him/her#self but more often than not - and especially in the case of excessive crying or colic - the baby needs your support to be consoled. #he/she# is at the mercy of #his/her# caregiving environment. Your availability, your unceasing efforts to relieve your baby’s stress communicate your love and devotion to #first#.  This is the foundation for a strong attachment relationship between your baby and you.  #he/she# learns to trust in you and to learn that #his/her# caregiving environment is indeed a loving and warm one.

They learn that humans behave in special ways and formulate expectations for human behavior that they don\'t hold for nonhumans. By acting on objects, infants learn that they continue to exist independently of action they take upon them (Bretherton, McNew & Beeghly-Smith, 1981).  At the same time young infants also learn through interaction with humans in everyday play, care and dialogue that people react to their actions and that these actions can be used as a means for communication (Bretherton at al., 1981).  Therefore at a early age, infants learn the contingencies of human behavior and expect certain actions and reactions from them, whereas they don\'t generalize such expectations to objects (Bretherton et al., 1981).  \n\n \nAs early as two months of age, babies react when a human behaves in a nonhuman-like way.  Research done with infants between one and seven months old revealed that infants  demonstrated signs of distress or tension when presented with unresponsive adult faces, which were violations to the expectations they hold for responsive human face-to-face interactions (Lamb, Morrison & Malkin, 1987). These findings suggest that expectations for human behaviors are formed very early in an infant\'s life.\n\nThe results of research using a distress-relief paradigm had similar findings (Gekoski, Rovee-Collier, & Carulli-Rabinowitz, 1983; Lamb & Malkin, 1986).  In these studies, infants as young as 2 months appeared to soothe when an adult came into their view, thus indicating that they had formed expectations for how the human would behave in response to their distress cries (Gekoski et al, 1983).   At this young age, however, infants did not demonstrate any protest when their expectations of relief were violated, rather Lamb and Malkin (1986) suggest that 2 month old infants\' anticipatory soothing may be a conditional response and that complex social expectations typically develop around 3-5 months of age.\n','  \"Differentiating between how humans and nonhumans act\"',NULL,'A few hours after his last feeding, Jared begins to cry in his crib.  Before his parents arrive, the family puppy comes in to the room and collects Jared\'s fallen pacifier. Meanwhile, Jared continues to cry. When his mother enters the room, she notices the puppy with the pacifier and, before going to Jared, she attempts to wrestle the pacifier away from the puppy.  Jared cries even harder now until his mother approaches the crib. Now, with his mother at the side of the crib, Jared quiets down even before she picks him up.','Jared now knows the difference between the behavior of humans and nonhumans and, as such, he has formed different expectations for his parents’ behavior and that of the family puppy. At two months of age, your baby also has formed expectations that distinguish human from nonhuman behavior. Your baby will not expect comfort from a family pet, just as Jared does not expect comfort when the puppy enters the room. However, after several weeks of interacting with you, your baby has come to expect certain behaviors from you, such as comfort when #he/she# is in distress. Thus, your baby is likely to get upset if these expectations are violated. When his mother takes a detour from the established route to his crib, Jared responds to this violation of expected behavior by crying more intensely. Your baby is also likely to communicate in this way when you violate the established norms. However, because #he/she#  knows the interactive patterns you’ve established, your baby, like Jared, is likely to quiet down merely at the sight of you alongside #his/her# crib.','?

If any adult comes towards #first#, #he/she# will automatically orient and smile.  But if this greeting in not returned or reciprocated then #first# will quickly sober and look wary.  \n? Fathers often get very different responses from their babies even at this stage. It is as if the baby has now learned that there are different styles of interacting. Babies expectations are built on experience and even the two-month-old infant is quickly learning to identify and recognise different styles on interaction. #he/she# may have learned that #his/her# father has a very different style of play than #his/her# mother. \n\n?

This is another rich strand of opportunity for #first# as #he/she# learns  to interact with the world of people.\n  \n? Babies at this age will respond positively to strangers and will become positively involved in play, as long as the stranger uses an approach similar to that with which the baby is familiar.    \n\n?  Babies at this age seem to respond differently to people and objects by reserving their communicative behavior such as smiling and vocalisations for people.\n\n \n? A two-month-old baby will try to engage the attention of the adult who is with them even if the adult is attending to something else. #he/she# will vocalise and jump around moving #his/her# arms and legs - all designed to get the caregiver’s attention.  Then when you turn to #him/her#, #he/she# will begin to perk up and smile as #he/she# waits for you to play.

These are signs of overload.   This is a reminder that you have to change what you are doing. ','The best solution to these mismatches or misattunements in interaction between you and #first# is to try to anticipate them.   This you can do by getting to know and respect your baby’s own temperament.  You must adapt to #him/her# rather than expect #first# to adapt to you.  Allow #him/her# to dictate the pace and style of your play together.  In some children, every one of their senses may be extrasensitive   touch, hearing, vision, taste and smell or it may be only one or two of these senses.

Some babies have touch sensitivity and can be sensitive to wet diapers or even to the fabric they are dressed in.  Even some babies are sensitive to being cuddled and will draw away so that in this case you will have to interact with #him/her# through eye to eye contact, lying on the bed together or talk and sing a lot to #him/her#.  As #first# is developing clear patterns of behavior, by recognising these patterns and identifying the way #he/she# is responding to these new experiences, #he/she# is telling you who #he/she# is and what #his/her# temperament is.

Researchers believe that these are \"visual mastery\" smiles (Piaget, 1952/1963; Zelazo, 1972) which reveal the pleasure of recognition.  The patterns are not all faces, they could be other familiar patterns such as a mobile pattern, though faces are likely to elicit the greatest response.  At this age, babies will smile at faces of dolls, mobiles, and so on.  As early as 2 months of age, infants show preference for looking at a human face rather than scrambled face like features (Morton & Johnson, 1991; Kleiner 1987 as cited in Slater, 1989).  Also between 2 and 4 months, infants prefer faces that are more realistic in appearance (several references cited for this in Cohen, Dislike, & Strauss, 1979) while later, children appear to prefer more novel patterns.  From birth, and especially between 2 and 5 months of age the infant acquires knowledge about the human face through experience with live human faces, specifically those of the caregivers.  These early smiles truly are smiles of enjoyment.   These smiles are very important in a social sense because they tend to elicit a response which supports the development of a strong parent-child bond and a social \"conversation\" between parent and child.','smiling in recognition of a facial pattern',NULL,'Katrina awakens from her afternoon nap to see her mother at the side of her bassinet.

Soon, Katrina looks away and her mother\'s facial expressions return to normal.','Katrina smiles because she recognizes her mother, who is by now a very familiar person to Katrina. By now, you’ve probably received these “recognition smiles” from your baby. You may also have observed these smiles when your baby sees a familiar pattern on a mobile or a doll, although your baby is most likely to smile in response to a familiar human face such as yours. In contrast to earlier smiles which were more of a physiological response, your baby is now smiling out of enjoyment at seeing you. And, seeing that enjoyment, you probably cannot help but smile back in response. During these interactions, your baby is not only exploring the nuances of the human face, but also learning how to engage in the give and take of a social exchange. She smiles, then you smile. However, most importantly, you are developing a strong parent child bond when you and your baby smile at each other during these face to face interactions.','?

Clearly, it is the result of a remarkable mental breakthrough for #first#.  All along #he/she# has been forming a model of a face in #his/her# developing cortex.  When #first# now sees your face, #he/she# has to make a huge effort to compare or match this image with the one #he/she# is developing.  The smile is the sign that #he/she# has succeeded in recognising your face!\n     \n?

The emergence of the smile and infant\'s increased ability to focus all contribute to the baby\'s ability to engage in this type of play.  As infants become increasingly able to engage in social exchanges with their caregivers, parent and child need to find the level and types of interaction that is the best fit.  Increasingly complex social  interactions are now becoming possible and if these interactions are sensitively encouraged, infants have the opportunity to learn how to focus and control their attention, control their motor responses (Brazelton, Kowslowski & Main, 1974), and to learn that social interactions are rewarding.  This encourages a synchrony in their relationship and enables a truly reciprocal relationship.  Researchers call this process \"attunement\" (Ainsworth et al., 1978; Stern, 1977).  They differentiate between sensitive interactions and insensitive interactions.  Each parent-child dyad is unique.  Children vary in the level of stimulation that they are comfortable with just as parents may naturally bring different levels of stimulation to a given interaction.  In a sensitive interaction, the parent takes his or her cues from the infant, reducing stimulation when the child looks away and increasing stimulation when the child looks back. (Brazelton, Kowslowski & Main, 1974).   The right types of guidance of the interaction encourages infants to be most engaged and able to learn from the interaction (Brazelton & Cramer, 1990; Hayes, 1984; Kaye, 1982). When babies are bored , they tend to search for more interesting things to attend to, while overstimulation causes infants to look away to reduce or process the stimulation (Stern, 1977).  In instances where mothers did not pause and let infants have a chance to respond, the infant turned away and in cases where mothers regularly did not give infants a turn, babies visually attended less and less to their mothers (Brazelton, Koslowski & Main, 1974).  [See Related Social LW- Seeking Out Synchrony at 1 month old and Reciprocity and Mutual Reinforcement at 6 months old.] Research suggests that insensitive interactions can lead to a sense of helplessness in children because they don\'t gain a sense of control over their social environment.  Babies who had a relationship of sensitive interaction with their mothers were more likely to attempt to elicit interactions with their mothers when the mothers adopted a \"still-face\" as part of the experimental paradigm.  Children with over or undercontrolling mothers did not attempt to elicit interactions (Tronick, Cohn, & Shea, 1986). ','\"Face to face conversations','Seeking interactive attunement\"','Patrick sits on his mother\'s lap. When his gaze meets hers, she gently bounces him up and down. Patrick smiles at his mother and makes cooing sounds. His mother thinks, \"Patrick likes the way I play with him.\" She jiggles him again and he continues to smile and coo. After several minutes of this face to face game, Patrick stops smiling at his mother and turns away. She  continues to jiggle him up and down and, in response, Patrick begins to fuss. He wants some rest time from all this play.','At around three months of age, babies begin to enjoy face to face interactions with their caregivers. By gazing at his mother attentively, Patrick communicates to his mother that he is ready to interact with her. He responds with enthusiasm to his mother’s initiation of a bouncing game. You may have noticed similar attentive looks by your baby. By this time, #first# is able to engage in interactive play for longer intervals of time. Your important task is to watch #him/her# for signs that #he/she# is comfortable with the stimulation you are providing. When you see your baby begin to fuss, it is time to slow down and take a break. Patrick is communicating his discomfort by turning away and discontinuing his smiling, but his mother continued to jiggle him as part of their play. Similar to the way Patrick began to fuss, your baby also is likely to intensify #his/her# efforts at communicating to you when your responses are inappropriate. When you respond to your infant in a sensitive way, reducing stimulation when your infant looks away and increasing stimulation when your child looks toward you, you will develop a finely attuned interactive style. With such a synchronous relationship, your baby will more likely be in an optimal mood to learn from your interactions  attentive when you stimulate #him/her# and inattentive when #he/she# needs some quiet time.','? As #first# becomes more alert for longer periods of time, opportunities for conversations multiply.  Don’t you feel that feeding time is still one of the best times for talking with and playing with #first#?  Diapering, bathing, tucking #him/her# in are all opportunities for interaction and it is these passing daily interactions that make up the building blocks for the development of your growing attachment relationship with #first#. \n\n? While you play with #first#, you will notice that #he/she# has many ways to tell you if #his/her# needs are NOT being met, if the interaction is not satisfying for #him/her#.  Some cues are more obvious than others: crying, spitting-up, arching back or pulling away from you.  But others are more subtle: #he/she# may just avoid your gaze when you try to talk and this is merely a sign that #he/she# in unable to tolerate any more interaction at this moment. #he/she# may become drowsy and use sleep to shut you and the world out.  Again, this is an adaptive mechanism and #first# is using it to protect #him/her# self form overstimulation.  This is how babies at this age regulate the pattern of #his/her# interaction with you.  \n\n? When you see #first# is alert and looking around, this is a sign of #his/her# readiness for stimulation or interaction.  Soon, #he/she# will be learning to reach out with #his/her hands to explore things, especially your face and body.  This is how #he/she# learns and it is an important step in the development of #his/her# relationship with you.\n','? The most important task for parents at this time is to learn their baby’s communication cues.  It is the key to developing a mutually enjoyable relationship with #first#.   Timing is everything and you can only play with #first# when #he/she# is ready.  What cues does #he/she# us to tell you #he/she# wants to play? Then when you are playing together, the most important thing is learning when #first# wants “times-out”, when #he/she# is calling out for a break.  Although #first# is so much alert and stronger than #he/she# was only a month ago, there are still limits to #his/her# developing capacities.  An over-eager parent may cross the threshold, overtax #his/her# system and thus interrupt the conversation process.   Getting into a “dance” with each other means taking every cue seriously, whether it is furrowing of #his/her# brow, changes in #his/her# color, tensing of #his/her# arms or legs, turning away from you, becoming more active, relaxing #his/her# body, a bowel movement, fussing, crying, eyes open and alert or eyes hyperalert.  Responding to each cue allows you to keep the interaction on track and allows #first# to shape the pace and pattern of you play together.  You are taking #his/her# concerns (cues) seriously and this helps #first# get to know and adapt to your style and pattern of interaction.  It is in fact, as it has been from the beginning, a mutual regulation process!   \n\n? Have you noticed that often times #first# will take a pause during feeding and look up at you?  This is a wonderful opportunity for #first# to study your face and your expression and the whole setting - the fact that #he/she# is so close to you, (touching your skin), held securely in your arms, while #he/she# is being fed is the perfect setting for a two month old baby.   There is nothing #he/she# would prefer more!   \n\n? As you play with #him/her#, #he/she# is learning how conversations work. #he/she# is learning that there is a back and forth quality to your interactions together.  There are times to “talk” and times to pause.   This is not only a model for conversations but it provides #first# with a model for all relationships, as two-way, mutually enjoyable, reciprocal, based on a respect for each other’s style, marked to keen observations of the partner and careful observation of #his/her# signs of distress or signs of well-being.  \n','Tit for Tat games','Repeat your babies sounds, facial expressions and movements','#first# is awake and you pick #him/her# up to talk to #him/her#.

This suggests that they can discriminate between faces that are familiar and those that are not.  Research showed that three month olds can recognize a photograph of his or her mother and that they prefer to look at it rather than a photo of a stranger (Barrera & Maurer, 1981).  It is important to keep in mind that a baby\'s visual acuity is growing sharper at three months of age, yet at a distance of six inches, the image that they see is still fairly blurred (Banks & Salapatek, 1983), though major characteristics stand out. In the coming months, infants discriminate more and more between familiar and non-familiar people and while now they\'ll smile at just about anyone, in the coming months they\'ll begin to reserve their smiles for their caregivers.\n\nResearch shows that between 3 and 6 months of age, children\'s memory for the characteristics of people increases (Olson & Sherman, 1983).  According to Gibson (1960, as cited in Cohen, Dislike, & Strauss, 1979), a transition in face perception ability takes place at around four months of age.  Around this time, infants begin to notice that certain relationships are unchanging.  When researchers tested infant ability to distinguish between a photograph of the face of their mother and the face of a stranger, the looking time of infants 4 to 7 months old was shorter when shown photographs of their mother\'s faces than the face of a stranger.  Researchers interpreted this as indicating that these infants recognized their mothers and perceived the stranger\'s face as novel and thereby more interesting (Barrera & Maurer, 1981; de Schonen, Deruelle, Mancini & Pascalis, 1996).  This was in contrast to three month olds who preferred to look at their mothers\' faces.  In similar experiments, infants were familiarized with the face of a stranger and then presented with both the familiar stranger\'s face and the face of a novel stranger. By the time infants were 5 6 months old, they looked longer at the novel stranger\'s face with which they were unfamiliar, indicating that after a brief familiarization period, these infants were able to recognize the face of a stranger (Barrera & Maurer, 1981; de Schonen, et al. 1996; Roder et al, 1992). \n','A preference for familiar faces','Increasing memory for characteristics of people\"','Holding Hannah up for closer viewing, her mother points to some family photos on the wall in her office.

While 3 month olds can tell the difference between familiar and unfamiliar faces and that they prefer to look at familiar ones, 4-5 month olds show that they not only recognize the difference but react preferentially to their caregivers.  While 3 month olds will smile at just about anyone, by five months of age, infants smile preferentially at their caregivers.  By around five months of age, many babies stop smiling at strangers (Sroufe & Waters, 1976). \n\nThe path of development appears to be one in which children first compare faces (at around 3-4 months), next they show a sober expression around a stranger (5-7 months), then they experience outright distress called \"stranger anxiety\" or \"stranger distress\" (Emde, Gaensburger & Harmon, 1976).  Four month olds tend to show that they are discriminating familiar from nonfamiliar through positive affect.  For instance, they show preferences for familiar adults, particularly their caregivers, at around 4 months (Emde at al., 1976) however, do not yet show fear.  Even though they smile more at caregivers, novelty interests them and they tend to look longer at strangers.  By 5-7 months of age, children are beginning to differentiate in ways that suggest that they feel a little less comfortable around strangers.  This in part depends upon the behavior of the stranger.   If a stranger locks into a stare with a five month old, the infant will look the stranger over in a sober manner and will start crying after about 30 seconds (Bronson & Pankey, 1977).  In a few months, the infant won\'t even wait to engage in prolonged inspection, he or she will just start crying.

At this age, your baby is no longer smiling at strangers, but #he/she# now will probably spend more time looking at an unfamiliar person due to the novelty of the stranger’s appearance. However, the interested look that you see on your baby’s face now will, in a few month’s time, be more of a wary look as your baby begins to develop a fear of strangers. The way your baby responds to others will depend partly upon the way you react. You will serve as a social reference for your baby, a resource to which your child can refer in order to know how to interpret the situation.

At this age, you may notice early signs of separation anxiety. #first# may become anxious when you leave.  #first# not only knows you but #he/she# knows that #he/she# prefers to be with you.\n  \n? Around this time, babies begin to develop an awareness that there are differences between people’s appearances but that people behave differently.  Now that babies have a good understanding of the human face and recognise it with ease a whole new set of challenges emerge. #first# is now beginning to see that the parade of faces that appear in front of #his/her# bassinet, all behave very differently.  Not only are there different colors, different shapes but these people use different words, different phrases and expressions, they have different accents with different rhythms and if they pick #him/her# up, they have different ways of holding and handling #him/her#.  They even smell differently.  These people have very different ways of acting  - different ways of interacting.   \n \n\n? The challenge for #first# is to learn to make sense and respond to these different faces and to learn a whole new range of communication systems. #he/she# has to find out what is common to all of them and what is specific.  What a challenge!  Now #he/she# knows that every face has two eyes, one nose, one mouth, lips, two ears, (though not always visible), a forehead and a chin. #first# now KNOWS a face when #he/she# sees one!  But after that, things get difficult.  These features not only vary in size but the skin surrounding these features may have a different color.  The amount of facial hair on faces will vary greatly; the eyes have different colors and may be surrounded by shining glasses; the hair will have a range of colors; ears may have ear-rings and they may not be visible under the adult’s hair; the neck may or may not be visible; the smell will vary greatly - and all this before the “strange adult” begins to talk!   Whe you take #first# back into your arms, you will probbaly get a broad smile - a smile of relief and gratefulness.  It is as if #first# is saying, “Yes, this is familiar territory.  This is secure.  This I know. And I know how to communicate with this person”.  #first# feels very good when this happens.  This is another step in the development of #first#’s sense of social competence. \n\n? It is not surprising then that with this new level of understanding, babies at around this age, become quite sober or wary when someone “strange” comes up to #him/her#.  When the person peers in at #him/her#,  #first# now recognises that this is a face and is slowly learning to distinquish between a familiar and an unfamiliar face.  This is a great achievement in itself.  But, if this stranger - it may be someone #first# does not meet on a regular basis - begins to talk and play with #first#, now #he/she# has to go to an even higher level - #he/she# learn a whole new language of communication, a whole new set of words and expressions if #he/she# wants to respond.  Often this is way too much for a four month old to handle.  \n\n?

When do babies begin to realize some things about themselves as separate agents or selves in a reflective manner?  Research suggests that this does not occur until sometime between 18 to 24 months of age.  [See related Social LW- 18-20 Months- Acting upon Understanding of Self and Other.]  However, before this children begin to make some early steps towards being able to recognize a sense of self.  Research suggests that at about 4 months of age, infants will attend to their image and those of others in a mirror.  Prior to this, children behaved as though they didn\'t even notice the mirror image.  This does not mean that a four month old understands that the image is a reflection or that it is them, only that they are beginning to notice and take interest of such images (Berenthal & Fischer, 1978; Fischer & Lazerson, 1984; Harter, 1983).  Understanding of mirror images grows quickly.  According to Fischer and Lazerson (1984), by the time children are one year old, they can even use mirror images to help them reach to the right location for an object near them.  By 18-24 months of age, most children show signs of self-recognition when looking in a mirror (though it can be as early as 15 months).  Researchers have discovered that if they put a spot of rouge on a babies nose (Amsterdam, 1972), at 9-12 months, none of the children react to it, by 15 to 18 months, about 25 % of the children react, and by 21 to 24 months 75 % of the children react (Lewis & Brooks, 1978).  By the end of the second year, they recognize that others are independent agents (Sroufe, Cooper, & DeHart, 1991).  This makes new social games possible, such as hide-n-seek or chase games.  Contrast this to a game 12 month olds sometimes play where they cover their faces and then peek out in a form of peek-a-boo (Wolf, 1982).  [See related Social LW, 12-14 Months- 4. Developing Understandings of Self and Other: A Preference for Imitation.]  Towards the end of the second year, children actively communicate their wants and needs to others by gesturing and other body language as well as using words.   Children tend to become aware of their intentions and the distinctiveness of their behaviors during toddlerhood.  They often want to do things for themselves and will let others know.  \n\nUnderstanding the self is also about understanding the concept of others and many researchers have argued that the two are linked in development.  The research of Dennie Wolf (1984) suggests a couple of stages that children progress through in understanding the differentiation between self and others.  At around 12 months, children seem to understand that others are capable of actions that they are not, but they don\'t view others as separate agents.  By the second year, children understand the actions of others as separate from their own.  Between 2 and a half and three, the understanding that people are independent agents emerges.  Children can understand that two different people play different roles and can hold a different set of intentions, beliefs, and so forth. \n\nYoung children\'s understanding of self is not reflective in the sense that they have a metatheory about their self.  Research by Robert Selman (1980) shows that around 5 years of age, children draw upon their physical attributes and behavior to explain what their self is. For instance, children might describe themselves as having yellow hair or as being a good boy.  By around age 8, children\'s theories reflect an intentional self--one that has feelings, thoughts, and motives that drive their behavior and might describe themselves this way.  For instance, \"I\'m nice to other people\" or \"I help other kids with their homework.\"  Around 8 or 9, children are said to have a sense of self that includes an inner, private self.  By around age 10, children\'s notion of the self becomes more introspective and they take psychological factors into account, such as moods and feelings.  As children get older, their descriptions include who they are in a social context as well. \n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:29:59','2012-08-22 12:29:59'),(2588,'s_4_2','Differentiating between Strangers and Familiar People- Early Signs of Fear','By 4-5 months of age, infants are beginning to behave in ways that show that they know the difference between strangers and familiar people.

Few infants can tolerate being left for long periods of time without their primary caregiver, but anxious babies feel this most of all.  In such cases, the father, the baby\'s daycare provider, grandparent or whoever is central in the baby\'s life, needs to take additional time so as to \"fill in\" during these separations.  All five-month-old babies need a high level of predictability.  The sensitive, cautious baby needs even more that #his/her# routines be consistent, and that games, schedules, #his/her# environment    all the routines of daily life    be as free of surprises as possible.','One of your key tasks is to help your five month old deal with separations.

Research shows that between 3 and 6 months of age, children\'s memory for the characteristics of people increases (Olson & Sherman, 1983).  Five month olds recognized familiar faces even after two weeks (Fagan, 1973)   By around five months of age, as infants begin to perceive not just the hair line and coloring of a face but begin to notice facial features, they also begin to distinguish between different faces  (Cohen, Dislike, & Strauss, 1979; Olson & Sherman, 1983). Researchers have tested infant ability to distinguish between a photograph of the face of their mother and the face of a stranger.  The looking time of infants 4 to 7 months old was shorter when shown photographs of their mother\'s faces than the face of a stranger, indicating that these infants recognized their mothers and perceived the stranger\'s face as novel and thereby more interesting (de Schonen, Deruelle, Mancini & Pascalis, 1996; Barrera & Maurer, 1981).  In similar experiments, infants were familiarized with the face of a stranger and then presented with both the familiar stranger\'s face and the face of a novel stranger. By the time infants were 5 6 months old, they looked longer at the novel stranger\'s face with which they were unfamiliar, indicating that after a brief familiarization period, these infants were able to recognize the face of a stranger (de Schonen, et al. 1996; Barrera & Maurer, 1981, Roder et al, 1992).  \nInterestingly, in experiments where infants were shown pictures of human faces and scrambled or asymmetrical face like features (control stimuli), 5 month old infants preferred the control stimuli over that of the human face, while 2 month olds preferred the human face (Kleiner 1987 as cited in Slater, 1989; Morton & Johnson, 1991).  The researchers conclude that the control stimuli seemed more novel and more interesting to look at for the 5 month olds, who had more exposure to and knowledge of human faces than the 2 month olds in the study (Morton & Johnson, 1991).\n\n','\"Remembering and distinguishing between new faces\"',NULL,'While shopping at the grocery store with Miguel, his mother meets an old friend and introduces Miguel to her.

They are able to coordinate looking and reaching , control their attention to a greater extent than previously, hold their heads up, sit up and so forth.  All of this leads to the possibility of increasingly complex interactions.   This leads to an increasingly mutually reinforcing exchange between infant and child.  The result is a shared dialogue in which parents frame the interactions and infants help to sustain and encourage it through their attention, smiles, and laughter (Sroufe, Cooper, & DeHart, 1991).\n\nResearchers (e.g. Brazelton, Koslowski, & Main, 1974; Stern, 1977) have studied mother-infant interactions in an attempt to understand what leads to satisfying relationships and what types of interactions produce troublesome or unsatisfying ones.  This research suggests that babies and their mothers are involved in an intricate dance of communication (Stern, 1977) that involves sensitivity to levels of stimulation and opportunities for the infant to be in control of the interaction.  Sensitive interactions are those that are in tune with the baby\'s patterns of gazing and looking away and provides optimal stimulation for the child without overstimulating him or her.  Insensitive interactions fail to correspond to the baby\'s elicitations of interaction or to the baby\'s need to decrease the stimulation.  Different babies have different stimulation needs and different parents bring their own expectations and energy levels to infant-parent interactions.  A goodness of sit is achieved when the parent-child relationship is in synchrony--allowing for optimal stimulation when engaged and reduced stimulation when the infant gaze averts, resuming stimulation when the infant looks back to the mother ready for more stimulation (Brazelton, Koslowski, & Main, 1974). \n','  \"Reciprocity and mutual reinforcement\"',NULL,'Now that Sara is sitting up and reaching, her father decides to play a game of hide and seek.

As newborns, babies often cry when they hear others crying [See Related Social LW, 1 Month-Crying in Response to Another Infant\'s Crying ].  While some researchers believe that this response signals the roots of early empathy (Martin & Clark, 1987; Hoffman, 1977), others think that the child may  merely confuse the other baby\'s crying with his or her own Eisenberg, 1992).  By six months of age, infants no longer cry when another child cries.  But approximately half of the time, they express interest in the other baby\'s crying.  This interest is demonstrated by leaning towards the other infant, gesturing towards them, or contacting them in some way (Hay, Nash, & Pedersen, 1981).  According to Nancy Eisenberg (1992), it is not clear whether children do this because they are concerned for the other infant or merely because they are curious.    By 10-11 months, children again become upset when another child is upset [See Related Social LW, 10-11 Months- Responding to the Distress of Others].  It appears that the upset of the peer causes real upset for the observing child more than to be an empathetic response.  At around 18 months of age (Zahn-Waxler & Radke-Yarrow, 1984), there is an increase in behaviors such as touching, patting, or doing something to amuse them an upset child [See related Social LW, 18-20 Months- Increased Frequency of Empathetic Responses to Others]. Such behaviors continue to increase in frequency between two and three years old and by three children are growing better able to take the perspective of others and are growing more responsive to others (Dunn, 1988), thought they are still not commonplace (Eisenberg, 1992).  For an excellent in-depth review on this issue, the reader is referred to Eisenberg (1992).

Then, he moves a little closer and lightly touches the infant\'s hand.','Whereas a few months ago Derek may have cried in response to another child’s crying, at six months Derek looks with interest and provides a comforting touch. These are a couple of ways that children your baby’s age may react when another child is in distress. You may have noticed your baby looking with interest at a distressed child, perhaps leaning closer, gesturing toward, touching or patting the child. Although these responses may indicate empathy for other children, your baby may be looking with interest at a crying child simply out of curiousity. Eventually, your baby will grow more and more able to take the perspective of others and respond when others are in distress. As your baby’s caregiver, you are an important influence on the development of your child’s sense of empathy. You are your child’s primary model of empathetic behavior. So, when you respond in a caring and comforting way to your baby, your baby is learning how to do the same for others!  ','? Some babies may respond to signs of distress in other infants but others may not.  As in everything else, there is a range of differences in infant responsivity.  Some babies are better able to read signs of distress better than others and some seem to have a pre-disposition towards reaching out and sympathising with others.  While this does not mean the #he/she# is able to sympathise with the infant in distress or that #he/she# can take #his/her# perspective, it does mark the beginning of #his/her# capacity to understand the emotional state of another, to become a nurturant and caring human being.  Caregivers have to help infants see and respond to other’s emotional states.   \n\n? Infants can and will communicate with each other if they are together.  They may smile and touch each other, especially if there are no toys present, although they will be unable to share a toy or play with a toy together.  Infants may also change in response to another infant’s distress by looking intently at the child or even patting the child.  This can be seen as the basis for the development of a sense of concern for others or an indication of the first signs of the baby’s ability to read and respond to signs of stress in others.  (In some cultures infants as young as 8 months have been seen to give objects to others.  So giving and sharing or being aware of and responding to others’ needs, or what could be called the development of empathy  is very much influenced by the child’s experience with adults and may be especially influenced by what #he/she# sees around #him/her#)\n\n?

Vocal imitation is emerging between caregiver and infant and as they “talk” back and forth to each other, the laughter is contagious, as #he/she# picks up on the happiness of the caregiver.  The infant learns to associate distinctive facial patterns, certain words and laughter with happiness and well-being.  \n\n?

You are showing #first# by your actions how to respond to another’s pain or distress.   #first# may not fully understand the pain of the other child at this time but over the next months, #he/she# will develop the capacity to respond with empathy to another.   #first# is more likely to act on this recognition, if #he/she# has seen your example in similar situations.  Still, it is also true that some babies are more likely to have this trait and if #first# does not show any evidence of this capacity, you will need to help #him/her# by pointing out instances of distress in others, to help #him/her# read the signs better.  ? Perhaps, the most important thing to remember is that you do not have to “teach” #first# to be good or how to respond to others in any formal way.  Rather, babies even as young as #first#, learn a lot about relationships through their relationship with their caregivers.  It is the experience of being loved and cared for unconditionally that predisposes a child to be nurturant and caring in #his/her# behavior. The only model of social behavior babies develop is the one #he/she# experiences through you and the other important people in #his/her# life.

While babies cry less now and for very different reasons than in the early months, it is still important to respond to your baby just as much and just as quickly as you did in the past.

Consoling your baby now also allows #him/her# to get on with things.  Still, interpreting the cry is now more complex.

In the first sixth months of life (and even before!) [See related Language LW- Newborn - On Recognizing Mothers Voice], babies are learning the patterns and characteristics of their parents.  During the second half of the first year, babies grow from interacting with their caregivers to establishing what one might consider a true relationship with them (Stern, 1977).  At around 6 to 7 months of age, infants begin what might be called the stage of specific attachments (Schaffer & Emerson, 1964).  This is when they begin to seek out their mothers and fathers specifically and to reserve certain behaviors for them.  Around 7 to 9 months of age, babies show delight upon the return of their caregivers.  They might reach out to be picked up, smile, squeal and so forth (Vaugh, 1978).  They demonstrate that they recognize this person in particular and want him or her specifically.   At around 7-8 months, as babies become able to remember that an object or person exists outside of their immediate perception on it for longer periods of time and thus can act upon their understandings of object permanence. [See related Logic and Number LW- 8 Months-Acting on Understandings of Obejct Permanence.] They are increasingly likely to cry specifically for their mother or father [See Related Social LW-8 Months- Separation Anxiety.] and are beginning to develop anxiety about strangers.   \n\n Infants can be attached to more than one individual in the first year of life.

Recall how at 5 months infants studied a stranger before they reacted in fear?  Now babies tend to react with distress immediately. They may pull away, cry, hide, and give wary looks.   Stranger Distress usually continues for about 2 or 3 months and it\'s length and intensity varies from baby to baby.   Babies\'  reactions tend to be more intense when their mother isn\'t present than when she is (Emde, Gaensbauer, & Harmon, 1976).  Sroufe and colleagues asked whether babies were responding to novelty or something more.  They studied what happened when mothers put on a mask in front of 10 month olds and witnessed children\'s delight with the game.  Then they had a stranger put on the mask and approach.  Babies typically got upset.  Afterwards, if the mother approached with the same mask, babies got upset (Sroufe et al., 1974).\n\nBabies are also sensitive to how a stranger acts.  If strangers stayed away and smiled from the other side of the room, babies sometimes returned the smile.  If they gradually walked across the room and tried to pick the baby up, the baby became distressed.  The more quickly the stranger approached, the more intrusively he or she behaved, the more likely the baby got upset (Waters, Matas, & Sroufe, 1975).  Where the baby is also matters.  Home is more comfortable than a strange place.  Familiar interactions are also important.  If a stranger plays the way that a caregiver does, babies respond with less distress (Gunnar, 1980; Sroufe, 1977).  If the infant is in some way able to control the strangers\' approach, they react with less distress (Mangelsdorf et al, 1991).  If the infant\'s mother is close by, the baby reacts with less concern (Campos, Emde, Gaensbauer, & Henderson, 1975). The baby\'s response also depends on how the caregiver responds  [See Related Social LW-10-11 Months- Social Referencing).  If mom looks worried, infants are more likely to worry (Boccia & Campos, 1989). Research showed that when mothers of 10 month olds previously demonstrated positive feelings towards a stranger, the baby was more comfortable in the stranger\'s presence (Feinman & Lewis, 1983).  Children react more to male strangers than female strangers (Brooks & Lewis, 1976) and to people who tower over them than to those who don\'t (Weinraub & Putney, 1978).\n','Josephine balks at her out of town Grandmothers advances.',NULL,'Josephine has taken an airplane with her family to visit her grandparents whom she has not seen in several months.

Even though she saw her grandmother a few months ago, she does not recognize her face as a familiar image.  The prospect of being held by a strange person strikes terror to Josephine.  Stranger distress coincides in development with a newfound mobility. It might have been helpful to warn Josephines grandmother that she was going through this stranger  wary phase, and to allow her some time to get adjusted before trying a physical greeting.','#first# may also exhibit stranger distress in other circumstances.

Research suggests that early forms of social monitoring are seen at ages as young as six to nine months (Klinnert et al., 1983) and that by 10-11 months of age, children engage in social referencing more regularly.  By 10-11 months of age, children are quite adept at monitoring their parent\'s faces to help them gain understanding of a variety of situations (Boccia & Campos, 1989).\n\nEarly research on proximity-seeking showed that not only did infants need their parents near them, they needed their parents to be emotionally accessible to them (Carr, Dabbs, & Carr, 1975).  Children needed to have access to their emotions.  In a study by Klinnert (1984), infants were shown a novel and interesting toy, though one that could be considered a bit frightening.  Previously researchers has trained mothers to provide certain expressions.  When mothers expressed joy, 12 month olds moved closer to the toy.  When mothers gave a neutral expression, 12 month olds maintained their distance from the toy.  \n\nResearch has been conducted using a visual cliff to assess social referencing.  A visual cliff is an apparatus that appears to have a drop off in depth but actually has a piece of plexiglass so that the drop is visual not actual.  While 12 month olds did not hesitate to cross a 4 inch drop, a 12 inch drop made them hesitate.  However if their mother smiled at them, 75% of the 12 month olds crossed, it their mothers showed fear, none of the infants crossed (Sorce, Emde, Campos, & Klinnert, 1985).  Research suggests that children pick up on much more than just facial expressions.  One study (Svedja & Campos, in press, as cited in Boccia & Campos, 1989) showed that children 8 and 1/2 to 11 months of age responded to emotional expression of voice as well as to facial expression.     \n\nOn balance, researchers Baldwin and Moses (1996) suggest that while infants as young as 12 months are good consumers of social information, they are not as proactive in their seeking as older children and that a fuller appreciation of social information does not evolve until later.  They also point out that some instances that appear to be social referencing might be a sharing of affect with parents (Waldan & Ogan, 1988)and that in some instances, infants looked at parents but did not appear to use the information (e.g. Hornik & Gunnar, 1988) in guiding their behaviors. \n','Early Social Referencing','Killian monitors her fathers reactions as he opens the front door for a delivery.','Killian is with her father, Eric, at home when the doorbell rings.  Eric picks up Killian and carries her to the door to answer it.  The delivery person is not familiar to Killian, who in response clings to her fathers neck.  Eric greets the delivery person warmly, and enters into a joking conversation about a recent delivery strike and how it has affected package delivery.  Killian begins to relax, but she still looks at the stranger intently and soberly.','Killian uses social referencing (she monitored her fathers reactions to the stranger) when deciding how to react herself.  In the few minutes that Killian and Eric were at the door, Killian went from relaxed and happy (before Eric opened the door) to anxious (when he opened the door) to wary and stern but less anxious (once she saw that he was friendly to the stranger).

Imitating others provides a rich source of learning for children.  According to researcher Ina Uzgiris (1972; Uzgiris & Hunt, 1975),children\'s ability to imitate passes through 4 stages.  In the first six months of life, infants match or reproduce behaviors that they\'ve engaged in and then someone has imitated.  The infant then repeats the behavior.  For instance, Meltzoff and colleagues (e.g. Meltzoff & Moore, 1977, 1983, 1989, 1994) have reported the imitation of behaviors like tongue protrusions, certain head movements, and the opening and closing of the mouth in infants during the first month of life.  In the second half of the first year of life, babies try out things that they\'ve seen others do but have never done themselves.  In this way, imitation becomes an important means of learning from others.  A third phase occurs at around 12 months.  Then children are able to imitate more complex new behaviors.  Case (1985) found that 4 to 8 month old infants who saw an experimenter make a bell ring by pushing down on a balance beam connected to it, tried to reach out and touch the beam in that spot themselves.  12 to 18 month-olds imitated an adult solution of a harder problem, pushing on one end of a beam so the other end went up and rang a bell.  At around 18 months, children make the fourth step and are able to imitate without much trial and error and become quite adept at imitation.   \n\nResearch shows that infants are also able to engage in delayed imitation during the second half of the first year of life.  Deferred imitation is when a behavior is observed, a period of time lapses, and then the behavior is imitated.  Researchers have found that children as young as 9 months old are capable of deferred imitation. Meltzoff (1988a) had nine month old infants watch an adult perform a sequence of actions on objects that were new to the babies (for instance, pushing a button to produce a beeping sound).  Then after a 24 hour delay, the babies were given the opportunity to play with the same objects.  Interestingly enough, they reproduced many of the behaviors that the adults had engaged in.  This was in comparison to babies who had not seen the adults model certain behaviors.  Meltzoff also demonstrated that 14 month olds could imitate behaviors that they had seen a whole week earlier (1988b).\n','Imitating Others','Jason Puts Shaving Cream on his Face.','Jason likes to watch his father Jed going through his morning ritual.  Jed usually is careful about leaving out his shaving gear, but this morning he left out the open tube of shaving cream.  While Jed got dressed, Jason took the shaving cream tube and squeezed out a large amount onto his hand and the counter, and tried to spread it around his face.  Invariably it got into his eyes, and caused him to cry.','Jason’s daily exposure to a family ritual is important to providing him material on which to base his social understandings.  At this point, Jason is able to hold a mental picture of his father shaving in his head, and combines this with information about his own body. Even without a mirror, Jason knew that the shaving cream belonged on his face, just like his fathers.

The onset varies with different cultures and appears earlier in cultures where babies are in constant contact with their caregivers (Ainsworth, 1967).  It emerges in all cultures by 12 months of age (Kagan, Kearsley, & Zelazo, 1978; Schaffer & Emerson, 1964).  By now, infants have developed very specific attachments to their caregivers and are achieving an understanding of object permanence. They get security from their caregivers so can become quite distressed when their caregivers leave.  Interestingly, even children who are raised in more communal settings such as an Israeli Kibbutzim or in an African Kalahari Bushman tribe show separation anxiety when their mothers leave (Kagan, 1983).\n\n \nSeparation anxiety continues to rise in intensity until about 15 months of  age when it peaks in most cultures (Kagan, Kearsley, & Zelazo, 1978).  After this peak, children become increasingly able to tolerate brief separations (Clarke-Stewart, 1973; Marvin, 1977).  When parents physically left the laboratory for a few minutes, 12 month olds needed more reassurance upon return than did 18 month olds who just needed brief contact with a parent (Sroufe & Waters, 1977).  It\'s important to remember that children were in a laboratory environment which was unfamiliar to them.  Research shows that for toddlers, when parents explain to children that they are leaving or increase their readiness for separation by interacting with them more, children are less distressed (Lollis, 1990 as cited in Sroufe, Cooper, & DeHart, 1992).  This is not the case with infants and reflects toddlers\' growing understanding. \n','Separation Anxiety','Jameson is Upset When his Mother is Out of Sight.','Lynn is at the dentist for a check up.  She took her son Jameson since she thought it was never too soon to introduce him to good dental hygiene.  While she is there, the dentist recommends some x rays.  While she is being x rayed in another room, the receptionist holds Jameson on her lap.  Jameson begins to wail as soon as Lynn is out of sight.','This is separation anxiety.  Jameson is now able to recall to mind a picture of Lynn.  No longer does it take a few minutes to sink in, he protests immediately when separated from her!','The beginnings of social interaction begin at birth with such behaviors as crying, clinging, sucking and cuddling.  Through constant positive social interactions with parents, babies forge reciprocal links with parents, which is called attachment.  At this age, when babies are separated from their primary caretakers, they protest.  These protesting behaviors will peak at about 18 months (but not the attachment itself, which will be lifelong).  Babies are willing to play at greater distances from their primary caretaker from 18 months to five years of age.  Attachment is facilitated by object permanence, when a baby realizes that an object (or person) continues to exist even when out of view.  Person permanence occurs before object permanence by a few weeks.  Here are some examples of separation anxiety you may see in #first#:\n\n? #first# cries when you go into another room, leaving #him/her# on the floor with some toys.

According to Daniel Stern (1985, p. 124), between the ages of 7 and 9 months, infants gradually come to the \"momentous realization\" that their inner subjective experiences are potentially shareable with others and that mental states, such as feelings, motives and intentions become matter for relating with others. With the development of infants\' awareness of others\' mental states comes the abilities to attribute intentions and emotional states in others and to sense whether or not they are in accord with ones own.  These developing abilities support the emergence of emotional attunement.  Emotional attunement is not reflectively thinking about another\'s emotions, rather it is the reflecting back of another\'s emotional state through ones behavioral response, where ones actions express a shared affective state without overt imitation (Stern, 1985; Thompson, 1987).  A typical example of emotional attunement occurs when infants are working on something such as stacking blocks or doing a puzzle and upon completion of the task infants will look at their mother who will gleefully say \"Yay!! You did it!!\". Infants will match the feeling state of their mother in their actions by throwing up their hands and shaking them furiously with a look of exuberance on their faces (Stern, 1985).  The mother\'s excited tone and the baby\'s happy outburst are in emotional attunement as they are matched in intensity. \n\n \nStern investigated violations of emotional attunement and studied how infants reacted when the intensity of a mother\'s jiggle on her infants leg or her pitch in saying \"yes, thatta girl\" either over or under-stressed the excitement expressed by her baby.  Stern found that nine month old infants would quickly stop what they were doing and look at the mother \"as if looking for clarification\" of her feelings (Stern, 1985).  Stern concludes from this research that typically by nine months of age infants have begun to realize that sharing emotional states is a way in which humans communicating with each other. At this age, infants begin to expect emotional attunement with others and a violation of this expectation, where the response of another is not in congruence to their own shared affect, is meaningful to them (Stern, 1985).   \n','Emotional Attunement','Wanda starts to cry after her mother receives bad news over the phone.','Wanda is playing happily with some soft blocks.  The phone rings, and her mother Iris answers.  After a few minutes of looking sober, Iris begins to cry (she has been told of an Uncles recent death).  Wanda looks at her mother, and begins to cry herself.','Wanda is now able to realize that her emotional states are sharable with her mother, and vice versa.  When her mother is upset, it is only natural that she will be upset as well.  It would not be surprising if Wanda tried to comfort her mother in some way, or at least approached her.','Emotional attunement can go from you to #first# and from #first# to you.

Alan Sroufe and colleagues (Sroufe, Cooper, & DeHart, 1992) point out that infants are born with reflexes to help them cope and get their needs met by others, but that over the course of the second six months, infants adopt a number of voluntary coping strategies.  While as early as four months of age, babies begin to show coping mechanisms, such as becoming able to turn away from sources of overstimulation, Tronick (1989) and Sroufe et al. (1992) point out that they don\'t maintain contact with the environment.  By 10 months, their response does and is different from the disorganization and lack of contact with the environment that are a part of younger babies\' cries.   Noticing the congruence or lack thereof between their own affective state and those of others (McKain, Stern, Goldberg & Moeller, 1985) provides an important social coping tool.  [See Related Social LW- 9 Months- The Emergence of Emotional Attunement.]  Infants learn early that others can be important tools for meeting their needs (Bruner, 1983) and now, they\'re discovering a new way to use others by considering information others provide (e.g. Gelman & Spelke, 1981; Scaife & Bruner, 1975).  They are growing able to assess the danger of a situation by social referencing [See related Social Learning Windows -7 months-Monitoring Caregiver Expressions: Early Social Referencing and -10-11 Months-  Social Referencing].  They are also able to cope by communicating to parents in a variety of organized ways (gesturing such as reaching up towards a caregiver or distress signals such as hiding behind a caregiver\'s pant leg, and so forth) that they are upset or concerned.   Researcher Judy Dunn (1988) points out that they learn to share the gestures and symbols that are a part of their family network and this helps to makes their needs clear.  \n\nBabies are also evolving a number of mechanisms to help them deal with the emotional aspects of social interaction.

Research shows that by 10-11 months of age, children are quite adept at monitoring their parent\'s faces to help them gain understanding of a variety of situations (Boccia & Campos, 1989).  They check on available emotional signals to help them determine how to react to something in the environment (Feinman, 1982; Klinnert et al, 1983).  Research suggests that early forms of social monitoring are seen at ages as young as six to nine months (Klinnert et al., 1983) and that by 10-11 months of age, children engage in social referencing more regularly.  \n\nEarly research on proximity-seeking showed that not only did infants need their parents near them, they needed their parents to be emotionally accessible to them (Carr, Dabbs, & Carr, 1975).  Children needed to have access to their emotions.  In a study by Klinnert (1984), infants were shown a novel and interesting toy, though one that could be considered a bit frightening.  Previously researchers has trained mothers to provide certain expressions.  When mothers expressed joy, 12 month olds moved closer to the toy.  When mothers gave a neutral expression, 12 month olds maintained their distance from the toy.  \n\nResearch has been conducted using a visual cliff to assess social referencing.  A visual cliff is an apparatus that appears to have a drop off in depth but actually has a piece of plexiglass so that the drop is visual not actual.  While 12 month olds did not hesitate to cross a 4 inch drop, a 12 inch drop made them hesitate.  However if their mother smiled at them, 75% of the 12 month olds crossed, it their mothers showed fear, none of the infants crossed (Sorce, Emde, Campos, & Klinnert, 1985).  Research suggests that children pick up on much more than just facial expressions.  One study (Svedja & Campos, in press as cited in Boccia & Campos) showed that children 8 and 1/2 to 11 months of age responded to emotional expression of voice as well as to facial expression.     \n\n \nOn balance, researchers Baldwin and Moses (1996) suggest that while infants as young as 12 months are good consumers of social information, they are not as proactive in their seeking as older children and that a fuller appreciation of social information does not evolve until later.  They also point out that some instances that appear to be social referencing might be a sharing of affect with parents (Waldan & Ogan, 1988)and that in some instances, infants looked at parents but did not appear to use the information (e.g. Hornik & Gunnar, 1988) in guiding their behaviors. \n','Social Referencing','Phillipa uses her father as a guidebook to exploring.','Phillipa is visiting her Uncle’s house with her father, Ian.  This is a place she has been a few times, but not recently.  Ian has asked his brother to make a few modifications in the environment (covering the outlets, removing his crystal collection from grasping height) to make it a more safe place for Phillipa to explore.  As soon as they arrive, Ian puts Phillipa down on the living room rug.  She peers around the room, and immediately looks towards her father who is happily reconnecting with his brother and occasionally looking at his daughter.  Phillipa then explores the room, routinely looking at her father to make sure it is still safe for her to investigate.','Phillipa is accustomed to monitoring the expressions and vocal tones of her caretakers (social referencing).

According to Nancy Eisenberg (1982; 1992), it is not clear whether this response grows out of empathy for others or out of upset that is caused them by the upset of the other person.  She reasons that because infants often seek comfort themselves, they may simply be distressed by the upset.  Often by the time children are about a year old, they stop responding to the distress of others as thought they are figuring out that they don\'t share the distress (Hoffman, 1982; Zahn-Waxler & Radke-Yarrow, 1982).

Research shows that babies have poor vision until they are about 6 months old and that newborns would be considered legally blind.  Despite this, newborns are sensitive to a variety of visual displays.  They can distinguish movements in their visual field, can track a visual object, and can pick up on changes in brightness (Banks & Salapatek, 1983).  Newborns can also distinguish between most colors, although they have trouble separating blues and grays (Adams & Maurer, 1983).  Most infants seem to come into the world able to perceive colors.  \n\n \nResearchers have studied both the acuity (the level of fine detail that can be seen) as well as infants\' ability to accommodate (to adjust their eyes) to bring things into focus.  Newborns don\'t yet have visual acuity (Lewis & Maurer, 1977) and while this will improve by around 3 months, they won\'t be able to see the way that adults do until they are about 6 months to one year old (Banks, 1980; Banks & Salapatek, 1983).  Using a technique developed by Robert Fantz (1961, as cited in Vasta, Haith, & Miller, 1992), an infant\'s visual acuity is measured by showing an infant a gray picture next to a picture with black and white stripes.  Because infants tend to look more at patterns, the infants will typically look longer at the striped picture.  The researcher presents the pictures repeatedly and, over time, the researcher presents pictures with narrower stripes, so that it becomes difficult for the infant to tell the difference between the gray picture and the striped picture.  Eventually, the infant does not look longer at the striped picture because the infant no longer perceives a difference between the two pictures.  Researchers using this technique have determined that a newborn\'s visual acuity is between 20/400 and 20/800.  Normal visual acuity of an adult is 20/20.  Infants\' vision improves significantly  by three months, infant visual acuity is around 20/100 and by 12 months, infants are just about able to see the way adults see (Banks, 1980; Banks & Salapatek, 1983).  This suggests the importance of helping babies see objects by holding them close to an infant\'s face, at about a distance of eight inches.  \n\nResearchers have also studied infants\' ability to accommodate or focus.  Earlier research suggested that babies couldn\'t focus their eyes.  However, recent research suggests that babies are more capable than previously thought.  Babies are not able to focus as adults do until they are 4 month old, but this doesn\'t mean that they can\'t focus at all.  It also doesn\'t mean that they aren\'t interested in focusing.  Kalnins and Bruner (1973) showed that one to three month olds adjusted the rate at which they sucked on a object when sucking faster brought a visual display into sharper focus.  If the picture faded out again, babies sucked harder to maintain the focus.   \n\nResearch suggests that it is not infants\' eyes that make it difficult for them to see, instead it appears to be the translation from images to neural signals in transmission to the brain (Banks & Salapatek, 1983).\n','Sensitivity ',NULL,'Hearing Maura cry, her mother comes to her bassinet and picks her up to soothe her.

When #he/she# is drowsy or fussy, even if #his/her# eyes are open, #he/she# will not be able to focus on a visual stimulus - and that includes your face!   You must wait until #he/she# is in a quiet state, without much motor activity to distract #him/her#, before #he/she# will be able to attend to whatever you show #him/her#.  Then #he/she# will be able to focus and look.\n \n? While objects that are distant from #first#’s eyes may appear fuzzy, newborns can focus up close. #first# can see your finger at less than 9 inches and your face at about 8 to 15 inches.   #first# will spend a lot of #his/her# waking time visually scanning #his/her# new environment.  Notice that #first# seems to be especially drawn to your face.    \n\n \n? Newborn babies are able to locate the source of a sound!  Babies will turn to your voice even if you are out of #his/her# visual range.  A baby will turn to the sound of a telephone even if the telephone is behind #him/her#.\n\n? Newborn prefer to look at their mother\'s face and attend to their mother\'s voice above all other stimuli. Babies may indeed recognize their parent’s voices, especially their mother’s voices, probably from their prenatal experiences.   #first# may turn to your voice and if you continue to speak, #he/she# will actually try to find the source of your voice. \n','? When #first# becomes quiet and alert, this is a sign that #he/she# is ready for stimulation.  Be sure to wait until #he/she# is ready for these moments, since alert moments do not follow any chronological time table, and your response must match the baby’s level of readiness.  The times when you play and talk with your baby are at once both exciting and engaging for your baby but at the same time demanding on #his/her# developing visual-spatial system.  If your response is not in tune with your baby then the whole experience can be overwhelming for the baby and #he/she# will not enjoy it.  Indeed, #he/she# may tune you out!\n\n? Some babies are more sensitive than others to visual stimulation.  If #first# seems to be easily overstimulated you should take your time to prepare for these moments when you are both looking at each other.  As #first# looks at you, #he/she# may like to be held firmly, without much back and forth movement, as you talk to #him/her#.  You may find that it may be better to interact with #him/her#, one sense or modality at a time.  Rather than talk and sing for example, just look first, and only when you assess that your baby can tolerate the extra stimulation, then add your voice, softly and almost in a whisper, at first.  Over time, be sure to allow your baby to tell you how much and what kind of stimulation is right for #him/her#.\n\n? As you look at and play with your baby, be sure to keep an eye on #his/her# motor behaviors.  If you find #him/her# stiffening or arching away or #he/she# may push #his/her# feet into your stomach, then you can be sure that whatever you are doing is not right.  It may be a sign of overstimulation.  Even something as subtle as finger splaying can tell you about the level of intensity or effort your baby is putting into this interaction.\n   \n? #first# probably does recognize your voice so that when #he/she# is quiet and alert, then you can begin to talk with #him/her# and once you find the right tone of voice and the right rhythm, #he/she# will respond.  Watch #his/her# responses closely.  ##he/she## may respond by looking back at you.  As long as #his/her# body remains relaxed and #his/her# color remains good, continue to talk.  If #he/she# begins to fuss or cry, then back away.  ##he/she## is telling you that #he/she# is being overstimulated.   \n\n? As you talk to and play with your baby, watch #his/her# breathing, #his/her# color changes, tremors or startles.   If your voice or the music or whatever the baby is attending to is too loud or abrupt, the baby may startle and change color or you may see tremors.  These are clear signs that the baby’s visual arousal system is being overtaxed.\n \n\n? As you look into #first#’s eyes and you see them getting wider and larger than usual, you may be on the verge of overstimulating #him/her#.  This “bug-eyed” look often is a prelude to #his/her# falling apart.

Haith believes that in general, the purpose of these scanning rules is to maintain a high level of firing rate in the visual cortex neurons to enable development.  The rule outlined by Haith are: 1) If the baby is awake and alert and the light is not too bright, open eyes; 2) If it is dark, maintain a controlled, detailed search; 3) if it is light but there is no visible form, search for edges using broad, jerky sweeps of the field; 4) if an edge is found, stop the broad scanning and look in the vicinity of that edge.  Attempt to control eyes in movements that cross over the edge.\n\nHaith (1980) suggests that these patterns are important to newborns because they maintain that maximal amount of stimulation to the neurons of the visual cortex.\n','Visual Scanning Activity',NULL,'Observing that he is in an alert state after his feeding, Jordan’s father holds him in such a way that he can look around easily. As Jordan looks around, his father watches his attentive expression. Then, he notices that Jordan is not just looking around haphazardly. Appearing as if he is searching for something, Jordan is scanning the edges of the window, where the light and dark meet. He seems transfixed by the contrast along the sides and across the top and bottom.\nSoon, Jordan puts his head on his father’s shoulder and he drifts off  to sleep.\n','Like Jordan, your baby looks at #his/her# surroundings in certain patterned ways, such that you might even be able to predict how #he/she# is going to scan in a given situation. When awake and alert, your baby will open #his/her# eyes if the light is not too bright. Similar to the way Jordan scanned the window, your baby will look for edges with broad, jerky eye movements and, then, once #he/she# has found an edge, #he/she# will focus on the area of the edge. These patterns of looking play an important role in your baby’s visual development.  By following these patterns, the neurons in your baby’s visual cortex are receiving an optimal amount of stimulation.','? When you observe your baby during #his/her# alert times, you will soon be able to distinguish between a bright alert look and a simple awake non-focussed look.  In this case, it is as if #first# is just gazing at nothing in an unfocused vague way.  Often after looking at something, such as your face, you may notice #first#’s eyes drifting away, looking past you into space.  This, in fact, can be a strategy a baby uses to avoid being overstimulated.  #he/she# is not processing anything but seems to be in a recovery mode after the excitement of the visual stimulation.\n\n \n? The best visual-spatial environment for a newborn baby is one that is semi-darkened.  If the sunlight is pouring in, pull the curtains or if the artificial light is very bright, it is best to dim them.  \n\n? Babies sometimes fall fast asleep after a period of bright focussed alertness, especially after a time of looking and responding to the human face.  Looking and scanning is very demanding on #first#’s developing brain and you will notice that #first# will sometimes be exhausted afterwards.  \n\n? You have probably noticed that #first# can be in a deep sleep, with no rapid eye movements or in a light sleep, with rapid eye movements, or in a drowsy state, when #his/her# eyes are half open or open and close.  While in these states, there is no possibility that #first# will respond to visual stimulation.   However, drowsiness is a transition state and with a little gentle rocking and talking, #first# can move from the drowsy state to a more available state when #he/she# is able to respond to visual stimulation.  \n\n? Sometimes, you may notice that after periods of alertness, #first# may close #his/her# eyes.  You may see that #his/her# eyelids are still flickering as if #he/she# were asleep but it may be that #he/she# is just shutting out the stimulation.  Babies will often “use” sleep to protect themselves from too much visual stimulation\n\n? When a cloth is placed over a newborn’s eyes, the baby may try to move out from under the cloth and may even swipe at the cloth as if to remove it.  This is called the “defensive maneuver” and is a reflex that comes into play when there is some interference with the baby’s visual and respiratory systems.  It highlights the importance of the visual system for the newborn infant and how much the baby “fights” to protect #him/her#self from any interference with #his/her# efforts to see and examine #his/her# new world.  Alertness - looking, scanning, searching - is the key developmental challenge of the newborn infant. ','?

Researchers tested youngsters as young as 48 hours old and found that they looked longer at circles with patterns that were face like or had concentric circles than they did at circles that just contained different colors (Fantz, 1963).  This has led researchers to suggest that these are inborn abilities (or are acquired very quickly, very early in life.)  As children get older, they prefer increasing complexity in the patterns.  They also have a preference for certain kinds of patterns.  They tend to prefer irregular over regular patterns, curved over straight lines, concentric over nonconcentric patterns, and symmetrical over asymmetrical patterns (Olson & Sherman, 1983).  Over time their preferences change as they mature neurologically (Banks & Salapatek, 1981).  Infants tend to focus their attention on the angles or boundaries of a figure (Salapatek & Kessen , 1966).

As newborns follow a moving object, their eye movements tend to be a bit jerky though they can track in the right direction. By two months of age, they are able to follow movements in a smooth action (Dayton & Jones, 1964).  Over the next few months, babies will learn to track more rapidly moving objects (Aslin, 1981).

If #he/she# is sensitive to visual stimulation, then approach each interaction slowly, making sure not to jump in quickly.  Take your time, speak softly, do not “jazz”#him/her# up.  Allow #him/her# to merely scan your face without saying anything at first.  Then slowly add on another level of stimulation, as you begin to speak to #him/her#.  The minute you see #him/her# beginning to fuss or merely looking away then pull back.  Give #him/her# a time out.   Then when #he/she# has recovered, begin again from where you left off.\n\n? If #first# tends to sleep a lot and is not available for much interaction, what do you do?  You may feel that you are missing a lot of opportunities to get to know #first#.  While babies need lots of sleep, there may be times when you can help #first# become more alert and help #him/her# become available for visual stimulation.  Just gently rock #him/her# up and down holding #him/her# in an upright position - this is easier if #he/she# is swaddled - and you will see that #he/she# is likely to open #his/her# eyes. This is an ideal position for giving #first# the opportunity to inspect you face and for both of you to learn to play and interact with each other.\n',NULL,NULL,'Some babies at the end of this first month may become colicky.  What happens to their visual capacities if this happens and how does it effect your relationship with your baby?  There seems to be no time for quiet face to face interactions anymore.   Your baby may seem to you to be crying all the time.  This is a very difficult situation but one that is very common at this time.  \nSome babies who begin to cry every day, usually in the late afternoon or evening, and continue for a long period and cannot be quieted.  Sometimes the baby’s body is exteremly rigid and #his/her# stomach seems to be “knotted-up”.  These babies seem to be in pain and their faces are often contorted and full of anguish as they cry and cry.  What can be done?\n','If a crying bout takes place within an hour of #his/her# feeding, it is possible that #first# is having trouble tolerating #his/her# formula; you may have to try a different formula.  If you are breast-feeding, you may have to check out your diet and stop using cow\'s milk or caffeine.  Under-feeding, over-feeding, or infrequent burping may cause prolonged crying. ','If #first# still cries excessively, then you should try some alternative approaches in the ways you help #him/her# console.  You might try carrying #first# around in a snuggly or a well tucked blanket.  Take #him/her# out into a new environment; the new setting may engage #him/her# enough so that #he/she# stops crying.  You might try putting #first# in a swing, or even for a ride in the car, because the motion and stimulation causes the baby to stop crying.  Be careful not to drive if you are tired, though; parents have been known to fall asleep at the wheel.  Some babies respond to a body (belly) massage with skin lotion.  Hypersensitive babies respond best to being well swaddled.  Unfortunately, there are some babies who will continue to cry and you have few opportunities to interact with each other.  In such cases, whenever #he/she# does stop crying and is able to remain alert for even a few minutes be sure to use that time to allow #him/her# to look at you so that both of you can look at each other.','Colic usually stops by three months, though some babies are colicky into their fourth month.  Even though it is a difficult time for the whole family, there seems to be no relationship between colic and a baby\'s visual spatial development in the long term.  It is a difficult time but the amazing thing is that colic disappears as suddenly as it came in the first place.  It will not interfere with the development of your relationship between you and #first# and you will still be able to enjoy the kind of face to face interaction you always had hoped for.   ','While crying and your ability to help #first# console does not at first glance seem to have a connection with the development of #his/her# visual spatial capacities, it does.  By helping #first# to deal with stress you are also helping #him/her# to learn to console and this enables #him/her# to be available for social stimulation. #he/she# learns to manage stress so that #he/she# can have more opportunities to quietly look at you, learn about you and begin to interact with you.

By 9 11 weeks of age, babies spent 90% of their looking time focused on faces (Haith, Bergman, & Moore, 1977).  This doesn\'t mean that babies recognize faces as configurations of features, though they certainly are recognizing that the eyes hold importance for communication and for bonding.  Faces hold visual interest for babies in terms of contrast, movement, and contour  patterns that appeal to babies (Sherrod, 1981).','Scanning and Focusing on the Eyes ',NULL,'As Derek’s father feeds him a bottle, he sees that Derek is scanning his face. Derek looks along the edges of his father’s face, and then he focuses on his father’s eyes. Even though he periodically looks away, he seems to keep coming back to focus on his father’s eyes. His father thinks, “When he looks in my eyes, it’s like he’s saying something to me.” In turn, Derek’s father reciprocates by focusing on Derek’s eyes. They hold this mutual gaze for a short while, and then Derek resumes scanning the edges of his father’s face.','When your baby is two months of age, #he/she# will spend more time looking at your face than at the edges of your face. Just as Derek seems to be drawn toward his father’s eyes, you may find that your baby is scanning your face more, while focusing especially on your eyes. By reciprocating, you and your baby will develop a mutual gaze that brings you closer, both physically and emotionally. Did you ever imagine that just by gazing at your baby, you would be strengthening the bond between you and #first#?','? As #first#’s visual acuity improves and #his/her# capacity for staying alert for longer periods gets better,  you will find that there are many more opportunities for interacting with #him/her#.  Feeding is still the time par excellence for face to face “play” as you both can look at and study each other.   The distance between #first#’s face and the breast is the perfect visual range for your baby. #he/she# can see your perfectly from there and now seems to seek out your eyes.  The “burst-pause” pattern of #his/her# feeding seems to be perfectly suited to allowing you and #first# to look at and talk to each other.  As you gaze at each other, don’t you feel that it is here you are both truly getting to know each other.\n\n? But there are other times which now provide excellent opportunities for eye to eye contact between you and #first#.   Changing #first#’s diaper can be one of these and using this time as a time for play can transform what is usually a very stressful event in to one that is rewarding and enjoyable for you and #first#.  \n\n? As #his/her# sleep/wake cycles become more established, #first#’s times for exploration are becoming more predictable.   #he/she# will be spending so much more time looking at you.  Now, #he/she# seems to be seeking out your face and may by-pass the mobile or other interesting spectacles to look at you!\n\n? You may notice that sometimes after a prolonged crying bout, #first# may become very alert and will be in a perfect state for social visual play with you.  It is as if, the crying acted to reduce excessive tension in #his/her# system because after all the stress and fretful activity, #he/she# quiets and becomes calm and then is ready for interaction.\n\n?  While visual stimulation was not very effective in producing a smile in #first# before, now dynamic visual stimulation are quite effective in getting #first# to smile.  You do not need as much rocking and nodding because #he/she# is capable of directed attention and your face and voice is what now causes #first# to smile.  Sometimes just your smile alone will cause #first# to smile. \n','? At this time, it is fair to say that there is nothing #first# likes more in life than to look at you and play with you. #he/she# is intrigued by your face because #he/she# is now able to pay much more attention to visual detail and is now able to study your face in greater detail than at any time before. #he/she# is using every clue to get to know you.  For you, too, it is a wonderful time of discovery as you see #first# more and more as a person in these new face to face interactions.  This experience of mutual gazing is the very glue that binds parents and babies together.  \n\n? Some babies are still in the throes of colic at this time and the thoughts of prolonged delightful face to face playful moments together seem so remote, even impossible.  It is true that the colicky baby has fewer prolonged quiet alert periods than the baby without colic.  If you have discovered how #first# can best be consoled or if you can help #first# console #him/her#self, then you have set the stage for making face to face play possible for you and your baby.   No matter how rare these moments are, they are vital for #first#.   Since excessive crying or colic tends to take place in the late afternoon or evening, it might be better to seek out the good moments for play at other times during the day.  You assume that “colicky time” will not be a time for play.  You could say that these rare moments when you and #first# can have playful interactions together, can balance the stressful period of crying when nothing you can do seems to alleviate the crying.  \n\n? Because your baby seems so intent on studying your face, being able to maintain a mutual gaze with #him/her# seems so be easy at first.  If #first# is a quiet baby who does not move around a lot and can easily be engaged, then it is true that interacting with #him/her# at this time can be a delightful and very enriching task for you.

Throughout the first six months of life, infants\' abilities to perceive and remember various visual features is growing.  Studies of six week old infants show that younger infants are first able to remember simple visual features such as lines and the line orientation of figures (Cohen & Younger, 1984; Slater, Mattock & Brown, 1991).  Newborns were shown and habituated to simple shapes consisting of two lines making an angle. These infants were then shown the two lines either making the same angle but in a different orientation than the control stimuli or in the same orientation as the control stimuli but forming a different angle.  The 6 week old newborns looked significantly longer when shown the two lines in a different orientation but making the same angle, suggesting that they perceived this stimuli as novel.  The infants, however, did not look significantly longer at figures where the lines formed a new angle but were in the same orientation as the control stimuli, indicating that they recognized the line orientations from the control stimuli but did perceive the angles formed as novel.  These findings suggest that newborn infants focus on the orientation of the lines and not on the angular features formed by lines in shape perception.','Remembering Simple Visual Features',NULL,'Lucy’s aunt was looking for a present for her niece.

It is also clear that #first# is now drawn to search for visual stimulus in #his/her# environment.  Will Lucy enjoy her mobile?  At this age, we know that babies like to look at simple visual features, such as the checker board or spiral designs on a mobile and so we can be reasonably confident that Lucy will enjoy her new gift.  Still, there is no evidence at all that any particular design is better than others.  Babies can see checker board designs or black and white line designs but they are attracted to simple color designs as well.  The statement on the toy that babies prefer spiral and checker board designs to other stimuli or that looking at these will necessarily promote your baby’s cognitive development is a little disingenuous.  As in everything else, let #first#’s behavior, in this case #his/her# gazing patterns, tell you whether this visual stimulation is appropriate or not.   It may be a simple face drawing but remember if given a choice, #he/she# will prefer your face to everything else.','? Designs that are too “busy” are not compelling for a two-month old baby.  Too much color, to many figures and designs and too much activity can overwhelm your baby’s visual system.

While #first# is attracted to novelty in #his/her# environment, it is also true that #first# wants and needs a stable predictable environment.  Too many changes in #his/her# visual environment can leave #first# disoriented. #first# can pick up on changes in #his/her# bassinet, for example. #he/she# will notice a new mobile or new surroundings.

Some babies are extremely sensitive to stimulation and are easily aroused or disturbed if the level of stimulation goes beyond a certain point.  Each child has a different threshold for stimulation.  Getting to know your baby is a matter of getting to know #his/her# threshold and what things or what situations are too stimulating for #him/her# and what is just right. The development and expansion of #his/her# visual-spatial abilities depends to a large extent on how you can help #him/her# manage visual input from the environment.','Before you decide #first# is overly sensitive or is easily upset or even a “difficult” child, be sure to check with your doctor to see if there are any physical causes for #his/her# behavior   allergies or chronic eye or ear infection or teething.  The first step is to identify the kinds of situations and the kind of sensory stimulation that tend to distress or overload #first#.  In some children, every one of their senses may be extrasensitive   touch, hearing, vision, taste and smell or it may be only one or two of these senses.   Once you have identified the situations, keeping the level of sensory stimulation down is essential if you are to reduce #first#\'s stress. ','It is important to be tuned in to the possibility that #first# may be easily overstimulated and to be careful in the way you present visual stimulation to #first#.  Most babies like to have a mobile to watch.  However, the very sensitive baby may not like a mobile with lots of different sounds or one that is too loud.   Looking and studying the object may be just the challenge for #him/her# but the addition of the sounds may be too much for #his/her# system.  Some babies may not like stimuli that spin and whirr incessantly. ','How #first# responds to these visual stimuli, may just be due to #first#\'s temperament, the set of dispositions #first# was born with.  There seem to be three basic temperamental styles (although we cannot say that your baby’s temperament of today will be the same ten years from now.)  There are babies whose temperament is easy and there are those who can be called slow to warm up.  These children are basically flexible and positive but take a while to adjust to changing circumstances.  The third group is made up of children who have very sensitive temperaments   these are more likely to be cry easily, they do not react well to changes in their routines or in their environments.   As you try to help #first# to adapt to #his/her# ever expanding environment, you can help #him/her# adapt by slowly and progressively exposing #him/her# to more stimulating visual stimuli.   ','By continually monitoring #first#’s environment to make sure #he/she# is getting the right kind and level of stimulation, you are making it possible for #first# to learn.  It is not an easy task if your baby tends to be easily overstimulated but with patience and love and a great deal of support from your family and friends, in the long run, #first# will benefit from the care you put into helping #him/her# negotiate the challenges of these early weeks of #his/her# life.  You may have to lower the sound level of you house if #first# is sound sensitive or even darken the windows if #he/she# is sensitive to light.  Some babies have touch sensitivity and can be sensitive to wet diapers or even to the fabric in which they are dressed.  By recognizing these patterns of behavior and identifying the way #he/she# is responding to these new experiences, #he/she# is telling you who #he/she# is and what #his/her# temperament is.  This enables you to tailor the things you do with #first# in such a way that respects #his/her# style and makes it easier for #him/her# to develop predictable and robust behavioral patterns and to expand #his/her# alert periods and be able to explore #his/her# environment and learn from it.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:29:59','2012-08-22 12:29:59'),(2608,'v_3_1','Increased Visual Acuity and Ability to Focus','Research shows that babies\' visual acuity and ability to focus improves greatly over the early months of life.

While it is true that babies cannot focus as well as adults until they are about four months of age, babies can focus more than earlier research suggested.  Instead it appears that babies cannot see well because they lack visual acuity.  While their eyes seem to allow a sharp focus, the neural pathways that enable the transmission and translation of information are not fully mature or functional (Banks & Salapatek, 1983).

They can perceive reds, blues, yellows, and greens as categories of color just as adults do (Bornstein, 1978; Bornstein, Kessen, & Weiskopf, 1976; Teller & Bornstein, 1984).  Like adults, infants four months of age group together wavelengths in a certain region of the spectrum as one color.  These regions have boundary areas in which people differ in color perception.  For example, the blue region has a blue green boundary which some see as blue and others see as green (Cohen, DeLoache, & Strauss, 1979).  Research indicates that infants are better at detecting differences between categories of color than within a category of a color.  For example, an infant would be better able to distinguish between red and green than between two different reds (Bornstein, Kessen, & Weiskopf, 1976; Fagan, 1974).  According to Bornstein (1978), cross cultural research suggests that categorical perception of color is not something people learn.  It appears that we perceive colors categorically due to the structure of the visual system (Bornstein, Kessen, &  Weiskopf, 1976).  Whether this is actually an example of \"categorical perception\" as defined in other areas of research has been called into question by other researchers (e.g. Werner & Wooten, 1979).  It has been suggested that whether or not infant and adult hue categorization is identical awaits further research (Banks & Salapatek, 1983).\n\nHow do researchers know that infants can distinguish different colors?  Early research relied upon verbal responses from children and, thus, children were thought to be color deficient for the first 18 months.  More recent research requires no verbal responses.  Using a technique called the habituation dishabituation paradigm, researchers simply record the amount of time infants look at colors.  The researcher repeatedly shows a colored object to the infant until the infant habituates, looking less and less at the object.  Once the infant habituates to the object, the researcher presents a new colored object.  If the infant looks more at the new object, the researcher concludes that the infant has \"dishabituated,\" which indicates that the infant notices a change.  If the infant does not look more at the new object, the researcher concludes that the infant has not detected a change.  Using this habituation dishabituation method, researchers now suggest that infants\' color perception is close to that of adults by about three months of age.\n\nNot only do four month olds perceive color, they show preferences for certain ones.  Research indicates that both infants and adults tend to prefer color centers (unique hues), rather than boundaries or mixes (Bornstein, 1978).  For example, a pure blue would be preferred over a green blue.  Also, infants and adults show a preference for colors at the extreme of the spectrum, rather than at the middle.  For example, Bornstein (1975) found that infants four months of age attended more to pure colors and they most preferred blue and red, the extremes of the spectrum.  This preference also seen in older children and in children from various cultures. [See Related LW VS- 30 Months- Exploring Color.]\n\nGiven that infants are able to distinguish the four basic hues at three months of age, why does children\'s naming of colors remain unstable until around four years of age?  Researchers suggest that color naming comes later because children attach labels to objects before they use labels to describe objects.  Researchers have also learned that infants are better at remembering color than they previously thought. They used to believe that adult memory for color was based on verbal skills.  Thus, they reasoned that infants would not be able to remember anything about the color of an object until they were verbal.  Recent research, however, suggests that memory for color may be a process independent from that of language (from Bornstein, 1978).  Researchers found that color served as a cue to help infants in a memory task.  When colors were added as cues, infants 18 to 36 months of age did better on a delayed hidden object task (Daehler, Bukatko, Benson, & Myers, 1976, as cited in Bornstein, 1978).  Using the habituation dishabituation paradigm, researchers found that infants remember colors in categories rather than exact wavelengths.  Infants have good immediate color recognition, although they are not able to remember after longer intervals of time. \n','Increased Color Perception ',NULL,'Sitting in his mother’s lap, Franklin notices the bracelets around her wrist, some in various shades of blue and some in various shades of yellow.

By 5 months they can use it fairly reliably to helps them judge depth for reaching and for noticing an object approaching them (Gordon & Yonas, 1976; Yonas & Granrud, 1985).  Retinal disparity is recalibrated as children grow older and it is affected by the changing distance between the eyes (Banks, 1987).  Research suggests that there is a sensitive period for development of binocular vision and that babies with misaligned eyes may not receive the early visual experience necessary to fully develop binocular vision unless the problem is treated before 1 year of age (Aslin & Banks, 1978).','Sensitivity to Retinal Disparity',NULL,'At about the time of her next feeding, Olivia begins to fuss and then cry.

They would loose interest in partly covered objects.  They couldn\'t visualize the missing part and thus couldn\'t recognize the object.  Now, children are able to reconstruct the whole object from the perceptual information that they do receive.  This marks the early beginnings of object permanence and mental representation.  Piaget studied the stages of object permanence in his own children.  At this third stage, he found that children required a perceptual cue to help them remember.

They showed babies a block with a rod moving back and forth behind it until the babies were bored with looking at it.  They then showed babies a rod and a rod with a piece missing (as it would look if obscured by the block) but moving in concert and measured which the babies looked at more.

The looking time of infants 4 to 7 months old was shorter when shown photographs of their mother\'s faces than the face of a stranger, indicating that these infants recognized their mothers and perceived the stranger\'s face as novel and thereby more interesting (de Schonen, Deruelle, Mancini & Pascalis, 1996; Barrera & Maurer, 1981).  In similar experiments, infants were familiarized with the face of a stranger and then presented with both the familiar stranger\'s face and the face of a novel stranger. By the time infants were 5 6 months old, they looked longer at the novel stranger\'s face with which they were unfamiliar, indicating that after a brief familiarization period, these infants were able to recognize the face of a stranger (de Schonen, et al. 1996; Barrera & Maurer, 1981 in Roder et al, 1992).  \n\nFive month olds have also demonstrated the ability to distinguish between photos of men versus women (Cornell, 1974, as cited in Cohen et al., 1979).  By six or seven months, infants can tell the difference between two faces of the same sex, as well as recognize a new photograph of a person they saw before in a different pose (Fagan, 1976, as cited in Cohen et al., 1979).\n\nFive month olds can recognize familiar faces that have changed pose and/or expression (DeLoache, Strauss & Maynard, 1979).  The ability of 5 month old infants to perceive such identity constancy regardless of changes made to the presentation of a familiar face is consistent with findings from research on the development of size and shape constancy in infants.   \n\nOther research has examined the ability of infants to perceive identity constancy across graphic representations.  DeLoache, Strauss, & Maynard, (1979 in Roder et al, 1992) familiarized infants with a color photograph of a face and then presented the infants with color photographs, black and white photographs and line drawings of both familiar and novel faces.  Five month old infants looked longer at the novel faces across all graphic representations, indicating that they were able to extract certain unchanged features of the familiar face and thereby recognized it.  Infants five months of age have demonstrated the ability to generalize from a real face to a color photograph of the same face  they recognized the face in the photograph after seeing the real face (Dirks & Gibson, 1977, as cited in Cohen et al., 1979).  Infants five months old also generalized from a color photograph of a face to a black and white photograph of the same face, as well as to a line drawing of the same face (Strauss et al., 1977, as cited in Cohen et al., 1979). \n\nInterestingly, in experiments where infants were shown pictures of human faces and scrambled or asymmetrical face like features (control stimuli), 5 month old infants preferred the control stimuli over that of the human face, while 2 month olds preferred the human face (Kleiner 1987)!  The researchers conclude that the control stimuli seemed more novel and more interesting to look at for the 5 month olds, who had more exposure to and knowledge of human faces than the 2 month olds in the study (Mortin and Johnson, 1991).\n','Recognizing Different Faces',NULL,'Needing to pick something up at her office, Erin’s mother takes her for the brief trip.

Originally, researchers interpreted this to mean that babies did not perceive wholes prior to this.  However, other research showed that when one to three month old infants were shown figures made of dashed lines and some part of it was discrepant with the overall form, babies attended more to the discrepant part suggesting that they recognized it as different or problematic (Van Giffen & Haith, 1984).

Babies are often given colorful mobiles soon after they are born, because we feel that if they can see, then these colorful displays will provide the baby with endless hours of satisfaction and indeed stimulation.

Researchers created a trapezoidal shaped window, the shape that a window appears to be when viewed from an angle because we perceive linear perspective (Ames, 1951).  So that babies could not use other depth clues, researchers put a patch over one eye and then showed them a trapezoidal window.  They then looked to see where the babies reached most often.  Five month olds reached out to either side equally often whereas seven month olds reached out more often to the side that appeared closer based upon linear perspective (Yonas, Cleaves, & Petterson, 1978).

Early research suggested that this meant that children had learned to perceive depth (Gibson & Walk, 1960) but more recently, researchers have discovered that this new development means that children have learned to connect their perception of depth with a fear of depths (Campos, Hiatt, Ramsay, Henderson & Svedja, 1978).  Infants can actually perceive depths at a younger age, as young as 1 and 1/2 months and perhaps younger.  How do researchers know this?  In the early work, researchers Gibson and Walk created what is called a visual cliff.  The visual cliff is an elevated flat surface with two sections, one section has a patterned texture, the other has a Plexiglas surface with the patterned section far below it.  In the early work, babies from 6 14 months of age refused to crawl across the \"cliff\" side of the surface (Gibson, 1960).  However, this didn\'t answer whether or not younger babies perceived depth.  Later researchers set 1 and 1/2 month old babies on either the cliff side or the other side and measured their heart rates (Campos, Langer & Krowitz, 1970). When on the cliff side, babies showed a decrease in heart rate which signals interest.  This suggests that they perceive the depth.  However, their response is not one of fear.   Older infants actually show an increase in heart rate when on the cliff side indicating fear.  The same finding occurs in babies who don\'t yet crawl but use walkers (Campos, Svejda, Berenthal, Benson, & Schmid, 1981).   Researchers believe that it is through locomotion that babies learn to calibrate distance and learn to fear the cliff side or that perhaps that once babies begin crawling they have more opportunities to fall and fear heights (Lamb & Campos, 1982).',NULL,'Making the Connection Between Depth Perception and a Fear of Heights.','Tita has just started crawling while on vacation at her grandfather’s house.

Now Tita is clearly frightened by this steep drop off where the stairs begin.  This new fear is related to her experience in moving herself around on her own terms (by crawling or scootching, but not by being carried).  By taking the initiative to explore her world, Tita has activated a protective mechanism to help keep her from getting hurt.','#first# may now be frightened by a variety of high places.

Understanding size constancy means perceiving that an object\'s size remains the same even when it is farther away and the object\'s image on the eye changes.  For example, a child standing in front of us appears the same size as when they are across the street, even though the image of the child on our eye is larger when they are in front of us.    \n\n \nConclusions drawn from a number of studies indicates that soon after birth, infants can perceive differences between the real size and the retinal size of an object, suggesting that it is an organizing feature of perception. Between 4 and 6 months, children begin to show some understanding of size constancy (McKenzie, Tootell & Day, 1980).  By 6 8 months of age (McKenzie et al., 1980), infants can perceive the size constancy of an object when it is viewed at various distances and not directly compared with differently sized objects.  (Some 4 month olds have size constancy, but research shows that it depends on the maturity of their binocular vision (Vasta, Haith, & Miller, 1992). Granrud (1986, as cited in Vasta, Haith, & Miller, 1992) found that four month olds with fully developed binocular vision had size constancy, but those without binocular vision did not have size constancy.) The research also suggests that this ability emerges over time and is still somewhat limited even at eight months, as these infants have significant difficulty detecting size constancy beyond about 70 centimeters away (McKenzie, Tootell, & Day, 1980).  It appears that sometime between 18 and 26 months of age, the ability to perceive visual size constancy across a variety of distances develops (Day et al., 1980).  The ability to judge sizes with changes in distance emerges over time and is still developing up to about 10 or 11 years of age (Day, 1987, as cited in Vasta, Haith, & Miller, 1992).\n\nSlater (1990) examined the ability of newborns to distinguish an object\'s real size from it\'s retinal image size when viewed at various distances.  Infants in the study were first desensitized to changes in the viewing size of either a large or a small cube seen at various viewing distances.  Next the infants were shown both the large and small cubes, where the small cube was presented at 1/2 the distance of the large cube, so that their retinal sizes were the same.  Slater found that infants looked significantly longer at the novel cube, indicating they were able to perceive the constancy of the original cube\'s size regardless of it\'s retinal image size and could detect the difference between the real size of the novel cube and the viewing size of the original cube.   There may have been several cues to the infants, including light and shade patterns at the different distances, which may have allowed them to make the discriminations.\n\nResearch by McKenzie and colleagues (1980) suggests that understandings of size constancy continue to grow throughout infancy and toddlerhood and that children become able to judge size constancy at a variety of distances.  McKenzie and colleagues (1980) wanted to further test the ability of infants to detect size constancy of an object when viewed at various distances and not directly compared with another sized object.  The researchers presented 18 , 26  and 33 month old infants with a large object at a distance of  60 centimeters in the familiarization period of the experiment.  They then presented the infants with the original large object and a smaller object at close and far viewing distances to test whether infants attend the viewing size or the real size of an object.  They found that the 26  and 33 month old infants looked at objects for the same amount of time in conditions where the original, large object was used, regardless of viewing distance.   In the conditions where the object was a different size, the looking time of the infants was greater than in the \"same size\" conditions, indicating that they had perceived the change in the object\'s real size. This result indicates that the infants perceived the constancy of the object real size across trials, regardless of viewing distance and retinal image size.  The 18 month old infants in this study did not display any significant differences in looking time across conditions, thereby suggesting that the ability to perceive visual size constancy across a variety of distances is not operative until sometime between 18 and 26 months of age.  \nIn order to determine whether or not an infant has size constancy, researchers use the habituation  dishabituation paradigm.  In this paradigm, the researcher repeatedly presents the infant with an object, in one case, a three dimensional model of a human head (McKenzie, Tootell, & Day, 1980).  The infant eventually habituates, looking less and less at the head.  Once the infant habituates, the researcher \"tests\" the infant by presenting the same size head at a different distance.  If an infant has size constancy, there will be no increase in looking time following a change in object distance.\n','Perceiving Size Constancy','Mollie’s monkey is still her monkey even when its on the shelf.','Mollie prefers to have her special stuffed monkey in her crib with her when she goes to sleep.

Not only does Mollie have a certain object that she associates with sleep (besides her regular sleep coaches, her mother and father), but she has matured enough to recognize that her special monkey is just on the shelf above her porta crib.  Mollie recognizes that even though it looks as though it might be a smaller monkey (since it is further away), it is her own monkey after all.  A few months ago Mollie would not have been able to make the comparison about the surroundings and their relative size, and thus conclude that the smaller monkey was only further away than she is used to when it is next to her (and appears to be larger than it looks to be on the shelf).','There are other instances when you may notice that #first# has achieved size constancy.

Even though research shows that babies understand object permanence earlier than 7 or 8 months of age, parent will notice infants acting on their understandings around 7 or 8 months of age.  [See related Logic & Number LW, 8 Months-Acting on Understandings of Object Permanence.] How babies search at 8 to 10 months of age has helped researchers to learn some interesting things about their visual memories.  Reaching out and finding an object consistently hidden at one location is a behavior that babies tend to show at around 7 months of age.  However, interestingly enough, when an object is consistently hidden at one location and then moved to a new location, babies tend to persist in trying to retrieve it from the first location.  This intrigued researchers and spurred a great deal of research focused on trying to understand what was happening (Baillargeon, DeVos, & Graber, 1989; Baillargeon & Graber, 1988; Diamond, 1985).  \n\n However, babies will continue to search in the same places where they found the object before.  If the child can\'t find it there, he or she will keep searching, but not directly to the spot where he or she saw you hide it.  Instead, they search randomly.  Why do infants have difficulty organizing effective searches when more than one hiding spot in involved? Research shows that the longer babies have to wait before being able to search for the object, the more likely they are to search in the wrong place.  For seven month olds, only a 2 second wait is too long, for nine month olds, the span has increased to 5 seconds, and for 12 month olds, the span has grown to at least 10 seconds (Diamond, 1985).  This demonstrates an increasing visual memory and the ability to overcome the strongly established early memory with the correct, more recent one.  However, researchers have learned that there\'s more than visual memory involved.  One clever set of experiments used a transparent cover to hide the objects and found that infants will search at A even if they can see that there is nothing there and the object is hidden at the second location (Butterworth, 1977).  Subsequent research suggests that infants need to inhibit the neurological impulse to search in the familiar place as well as remember that the object is at a new location (Diamond, 1991a, 1991b).\n','Location Memory and Searching Behavior','Lucas looks to the front door when he hears his mothers voice on the answering machine.','Lucas’s father picked him up early from day care today.

This helps in word learning because the child can attend to pictures of many different things and learn the words for them. At 20 to 24 months, babies follow a point and then a name (Murphy, 1978).\n\nResearch focused on 21-35 month olds (Whitehurst et al., 1988) considered the effects of different patterns of parent -child interaction around storybook reading.  This included how parents asked questions, whether they asked children to point to certain objects and so forth.  Some parents were asked to increase the number of open-ended and function/attribute questions that they asked (supporting their child\'s attempts to answer these), as well as engage in more expansions, to decrease the amount of straight reading and the number of questions that could be answered by straight pointing.

As they move around, they \"map out\" their spatial environment in new ways and from a variety of perspectives.   According to researcher, Linda Acredelo, the period of time when an infant starts to crawl is very important for helping the child move from a reliance mostly on landmarks to help them recall information about space and to begin to develop a real \"container\" sense of space (Acredolo, 1985, p. 136).  Acredolo cites a number of research studies to support this belief.  Goldfield and Dickerson (1981) showed that when infant were able to track their movement as someone moved them around a table, they could search more accurately for objects. However 8 and 1/2 month olds relied more on landmarks such as the color of the containers than 9 and 1/2 month olds.  Acredolo, Adams, and Goodwyn (1984) found a similar trend between 12 and 18 month olds.  Visual tracking and active movement were more important to the success of the 12 month olds than for the 18 month olds.  Presumably, the 18 month olds  had learned how to coordinate different spatial perspectives without active movement and visual tracking.','Mapping out Spaces ','Visual Tracking and Crawling: Scott Watches Where he is Going.','Scott is crawling around in the kitchen.

Researchers wondered if infants could use information from movement the way that adults do in order to determine things about form.  In perception experiments, researchers have attached lights to parts of the body and had the person move.  Adults are quickly able to determine that it is a person from the movement.  By nine months of age, babies can, too.  \n\nYounger babies can use motion to determine the difference between forms.  Researchers (Berenthal, Profitt, & Cutting, 1984) showed 3 5 month olds images with lights that looked like a person walking.  One image was right side up, another was upside down, and the last one was scrambled so it didn\'t look like a person.  When the forms didn\'t move, babies treated them as the same, but when the forms did move, the babies treated them as though they were different and could clearly differentiate between them.

Developmentally, children progress from considering space in relation to themselves towards having an objective sense of space.  They progress from being able to use spatial clues that are more obvious to those that are less obvious.  They also show more sophisticated understandings in environments that are familiar and relatively free from stress and ones that they are able to move around in (Acredolo, 1985).\n\nEarly work by Piaget suggested the following stages in how babies relate to space.  From birth to around four months, they interact with space, but don\'t have a sense of how space and self are separate.   Around 4 to 10 months old, children tend to have a subjective, ego centric notion of space.  This means that they interpret space in relation to their own bodies and movements.  By around 10 12 months, children are entering a transitional phase where they make certain kinds of errors that show that they still interpret spatial relationships in relation to their own bodies, but they don\'t make these errors in all circumstances.  By 12 to 18 months, many infants are establishing an objective notion of space and relate the location of objects to other objects rather than to themselves.  \n\nClever research by Linda Acredolo and others (Acredolo, 1978; Acredolo & Evans, 1980; Cornell & Heth, 1979, Rieser, 1979) generally supports these stages and clarifies what babies understand.  For example, in one study, infants were put into an empty room with two identical windows, one on the right and one on the left.  Each time a buzzer went off, a friendly face appeared in one of the windows  the same one each time.  After a while, the babies learned to look to that window when they hear the buzzer.  Then the babies were moved to the opposite side of the room.  At six and eleven months old, babies looked to the wrong window when the buzzer, using their own bodies as a point of reference. (So if they looked to their right for the learning trials, they still looked there.)  However, by 16 months old, babies looked to the right window suggesting that they used spatial cues, not egocentric cues to decide where to look.  Researchers wondered what would happen if more information was given so they placed a yellow star over the correct window. It helped about half of the 11 month olds override their egocentric orientation and decide where to look.  When the spatial clue was very obvious, like a blinking light, 9  and 11 month olds used it to find the correct window. Six month olds responded by looking both ways showing that they knew that the clue showed something about the objective location of the window.  Additional research (Cornell & Heth, 1979) showed that four month olds could not use place cues.  Research by Goldfield and Dickerson (1981) supports that 8 and 1/2 month olds were more tied to egocentric cues than 9 and 1/2 month olds.  \n    \n \nLater research suggested that the learning trials reinforced a certain motor pattern and increased the likelihood that children would repeat the action  looking in the wrong direction  rather than reorienting to where the object is (Bremner, 1978).  It also suggested that the stress of unfamiliar environments makes it more likely that children will use egocentric patterns of responding (Acredolo, 1979).  Also, when children actively move in relation to the object rather than having someone move them, they tend to do better (Acredolo, Adams & Goodwyn, 1984).  Interestingly enough, the more possible hiding locations the less likely babies are to respond egocentrically (Braine & Elder, 1981).  The studies here all describe instances where the baby was moved (or moved) relative the objects, not vice versa and where the looking was in a small scale environment.  \nFor an excellent in depth review of this research, see Acredolo, L, P.

Some researchers have considered whether certain rhythms such as those that sound like a heartbeat are more soothing than other sounds because they simulate the prenatal environment.  The research on this point is mixed (Hargreaves, 1986).  Brackbill and colleagues (1966) found that it was no more soothing than lullabies or the sound of a metronome while Salk (1962) found that a heartbeat sound was more soothing.  \n\nTrehub & Henderson (1994; as cited in Trehub & Schellenberg, 1995) wanted to know whether infants enjoyed lullabies more than other types of music, such as traditional adult songs, and so they compared infants’ reactions to these songs. The researchers had grandmothers sing both kinds of songs to their six month old grandchildren and videotaped the infants as they listened to these songs.  Trehub & Henderson’s findings suggested that infants preferred the sounds of the lullaby to the sounds of the adult song. Because they wondered if infants seemed to prefer the lullaby to the adult song because the lullaby may have seemed more directed toward them than the adult song, Trehub & Henderson (1994) compared infants\' enjoyment of lullabies with “child-directed” play songs.  They found that infants still seem to prefer the sounds of the lullaby more than the play song, even when they were not distressed or in need of soothing.\n\nResearch findings suggest that infants respond to music with various reactions such as smiles, bouncing and vocalizations, depending upon musical elements such as tempo and pitch. (Trehub & Schellenberg, 1995).  Nine and 13 month old infants who listened to two very different types of songs, one with a very upbeat tempo and one with a very slow tempo, responded differently to the songs, (bouncing more to the faster song), as judged by adults who watched the infants’ videotaped reactions (Trehub, 1993, as cited in Trehub & Schellenberg, 1995).  Research also suggests that infants are capable of perceiving musical elements, such as melodic and pitch contours and temporal patterning in adults speech and that infants respond with “heightened interest” when adults intensify these elements while talking (Trehub & Schellenberg, 1995).\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:00','2012-08-22 12:30:00'),(2634,'m_0_2','Discriminating Sounds','Newborns are able to discriminate between different sounds.  Research suggests that they rely mainly on intensity and frequency in order to do so.  In habituation studies (in which infants hear a certain tone until they no longer respond to it and then new tones are played), babies renewed their responses to the new tones showing that they could distinguish between the old sound and the new sound even when the sounds involved fine discriminations between different frequencies. Babies younger than five days old responded to the tones with changes in heart rate and physical movement (Bridger, 1961).  Matched pairs of ascending and descending tonal sequences were particularly arousing to infants (Eisenberg, 1976).\n\nFrom the earliest ages at which children were tested (one month) they were able to hear the difference between different categories of sound.  Like adults, they demonstrated categorical perception--the sound \"ba\" is different from the sound \"pa.\" (Eimas, Siqueland, & Jusczyk, 1971)  However, unlike adults, they were able to hear the difference between unfamiliar sounds from different languages (for instance the Czech \"za\" and \"ra\") (Trehub, 1976)!  Beyond this, as they got older, they lost the ability to \"hear\" the differences. By 10-12 months, children had lost their ability to discriminate sounds in languages they have never heard (Werker & Tess, 1984).  This pattern of early perceptual ability with speech sounds which gradually disappears is also found in children\'s perception of music \n\nResearch shows that infants perceive differences between musical sounds. In a study of infant categorical perception of different non-speech sounds, 2 month olds listened to pairs of sounds differing in rise time (the amount of time is takes for a sound to reach its full intensity).  The infants detected a difference only between sounds that were from different categories of sound rise time.  Therefore, the infants demonstrated categorical perception for non-speech sounds, similar to adults.\n\nThis is not to imply that infants can distinguish all phonemically relevant stimuli or that speech perception does not develop as children get older (Trehub, Bull, & Schneider, 1981).  There are certain types of categories and certain placements of contrasting phonemes that infants were not able to discriminate (Eilers & Minifie, 1975) and certain cues (such as vowel durations) (Eilers, 1977) that contributed to their ability to discriminate certain sounds.  Six month old infants exposed to and trained on these contrasts showed improvement (Holmberg, Morgan, & Kuhl, 1977), but by 12 months, so did children who were not trained (Eilers, 1977). \n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:00','2012-08-22 12:30:00'),(2635,'m_1_1','Becoming Dominated by Acoustic Stimuli ','In infants as early as a few weeks of age, acoustic dominance can be observed.  Infants will typically stop moving and quiet while they attend to the sound.  According to Paul Michel (1973), by two months of age, infants will lie motionless and fix their attention when someone sings or plays an instrument.  He recounts an instance when a two month old boy stopped crying immediately when his father played the violin and of a 27 month old child who responded similarly to the playing of a piano.  According to Michel, by five months of age, acoustic dominance can be observed for up to a half an hour.  These findings are important because they reveal that infants do pay attention to music at a very early age and that they demonstrate pleasure in hearing from a very early age.  Some researchers describe the first six months of life as the time of “learning to hear” (Michel, 1973, p.15).

Timbre is a distinctive quality of sound that differentiates it from other sounds of similar pitch and loudness, for instance, timbre is what differentiates a flute playing the same note and loudness as a piano.  According to Fridman (1973) infants listen to voice timbre.  All children and adults have different timbres to their voices.  It is possible to distinguish even very young children by timbre.  In one study, a number of children between 12 and 14 months old repeated the word “good-bye.” Each revealed a different timbre and a different pitch in how they repeated the words.  According to Fridman, infants use this information to recognize familiar voices.  By 2-3 months of age, infants are able to distinguish different timbre when played two different notes (Michel, 1973).

Typically, a sound needs to be about 10 20 decibels louder for an infant to hear it (Hecox & Deegan, 1985; Schulman Galambos & Galambos, 1979). This is especially the case with low pitched sounds (Sinnott, Pisoni, & Aslin, 1984).  It takes many years for children\'s hearing to reach its peak sensitivity.  By the time children are twelve or thirteen, they can hear the same decibels as adults do (Sroufe, 1994).  However, this is about the time that sensitivity to hearing peaks  hearing does not simply continue to improve as people get older (Vasta, Haith, & Miller, 1992).  People are most sensitive to higher frequencies even earlier  around 4 or 5 years of age  with no improvement beyond this age (Trehub et al., 1988, as cited in Vasta, Haith, & Miller, 1992).\n\nResponse to noise is individualized even in infants.  Some infants will turn to the sound of a whisper or a low, well-timed, modulated high-pitched voice and others turn to the sound of a sing-song repetitive series of sounds or a louder noise.  If the baby is asleep he/she can shut out a loud noise and if he is alert he/she will respond to abrupt loud noises by shooting off a startle and if it is a very sharp sound, physiological stress signs, color change and tremors (Brazelton & Nugent, 1995). \n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:00','2012-08-22 12:30:00'),(2638,'m_2_1','Playing with Sounds','Between the ages of 2 to 6 months, infants begin to vocalize more frequently and become more interested in sound.  This type of early musical behavior continues into the second half of the first year, where infants typically repeat their own, self-produced sounds in a more prolonged manner (Kessen, Levine, & Wendrich, 1979).  As early as 8-12 weeks (and in some cases, even earlier), babies begin to coo (uttering a vowel like sound such as \"ah\" and \"oo\"), smile, and make eye-contact as they interact with their caregivers (Stark, 1979).  Infants often coo when they are comfortable, usually in response to a parent smiling and talking.  While cooing and smiling usually take place in social settings, research has shown that babies at this age will also make non-cry vocalizations even when there is nobody interacting with them (Wolff, 1987).

However, existing studies suggests that infants at this age are sensitive to changes in sound.  Researchers have studied the association between the sound quality of the spoken word the infant processes and the infant’s sensitivity to it.  From the perspective of the pre-linguistic infant, speech is simply a series of complex sounds that varies over time (Trehub et al, 1993).\n\nCooper & Aslin (1990) state that the unique acoustical features of “infant-directed” speech (the falsetto that many American caregivers use when communicating with an infant) may specifically elicit and maintain infant attention.  In one study, Karzon (1985) demonstrated that 1- to 4-month old infants could distinguish a single change in a 3-syllable nonsense word (e.g., “marana” vs. “malana”) if the speaker used a high pitch and slow, exaggerated phrasing.  Wormith et al. (1975) also found that one-month old infants are capable of discriminating among pure tones varying in frequency.  This may be an indication of the effect of the “musical” qualities of speech directed at the infant.\n\nIn their own study, Cooper & Aslin (1990) state that mothers with four-month old children tended to speak with a higher pitch and shorter pauses than those mothers with newborn infants.  This exaggeration of the elements of infant-directed speech, therefore, appeared to increase as the infant aged.  Yet they posited that although one-month old infants have had less experience listening to infant-directed speech than four-month olds, within the first weeks after birth the infant will still show a preference for infant-directed speech.\n\nTrehub (1973) found that infants from one to four months old can detect certain vowel changes when these follow a consonant or when they are spoken alone.  She argues that perhaps, by using synthetically generated sounds, one could discover the minimal cues needed for infants’ vowel recognition (her view being that the human voice is simply too variable).  Again, differentiating between vowel tones can perhaps foreshadow an infant\'s ability to differentiate between musical tones.\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:00','2012-08-22 12:30:00'),(2640,'m_2_3','Distinguishing the Timbre of Two Different Notes','By 2-3 months of age, infants are able to distinguish different timbre when played two different notes (Michel, 1973).

By three to three and a half months of age, infants were able to differentiate two notes of similar timbre that differed in pitch by barely two octaves.

Papousek and Papousek (1981) suggest that even infants as young as two months can imitate pitch.  Kessen and colleagues taught mothers to train their infants to match a pitch that the mother played for them on a pitch pipe. After 40 days of practice, babies younger than six months old were trained to sing back pitches (the minor triad D-F-A).  The infants were successful most of the time and seemed to enjoy and work hard at the task.  The infants’ ability was independent of the parents’ musical ability.  Three month olds could repeat the last note of a piece in perfect pitch (Platt, 1933).  At six months, they could sing back pitches most of the time and in perfect tune (Kessen, Levine, & Wendrich, 1979).

Researchers have found that infants can actually recognize variations in pitch (Kessen, Levine, & Wendrich, 1979).  In fact, the infant’s perception of pitch is actually quite similar to that of adults.  For example, just as pitch becomes more difficult for adults to detect with increased dissonance (or harshness), it becomes more difficult for infants to discern as well (Clarkson, Martin, and Miciek, 1996).  Like adults, infants prefer to listen to consonant, or “pleasing” sounding tones (Trainor & Heinmiller, 1998).  Trainor and Heinmiller further conclude that this consonance/dissonance discernment is basic to human beings and not due to a learned knowledge of musical structure, for 6 month olds do not have such knowledge. \n\nInfants are better at hearing and responding to high-pitched sounds than low pitched ones (Kearsley, 1973). This enhanced perception of and preference for high pitched sounds fits with the way adults speak to infants, which is referred to as \"motherese.\"  Motherese is a special intonation pattern, with a musical quality in the higher pitch, more variable (rising and falling) pitch, and exaggerated stress (Sachs, 1989).  Fernald gave four month old babies an opportunity to turn his or her head towards a tape with a female voice talking with baby talk or without it.  Babies preferred to turn towards the voice using baby talk (Fernald, 1985).  Some research showed that even two month olds paid more attention to a female voice with a rising intonation (Sullivan & Horowitz, 1983).  Other research shows that even infants 2 days of age prefer motherese (Cooper & Aslin, 1990).  Stern and his colleagues (1983) showed that adults may be more prone to exaggerating the prosody of their speech to a three or four-month older than a newborn or a toddler because the baby at this age may be the most likely of the three to be amused by such affectively rich vocalizations. \n\nRanges in pitch appear to interest infants.  Infants respond more to sounds and sights that involve contrast and change (Eisenberg, 1976, as cited in Fernald & Kuhl, 1987).  Marshall Haith (1980, as cited in Fernald & Kuhl, 1987), a developmental psychologist who studies infant vision, proposes that when infants scan objects that have a lot of contrasting features, they are activating neurons in their visual system.  Fernald and Kuhl (1987) suggest that the same process may occur when infants hear sounds that have a range of pitch.  Motherese may activate neurons in the infant\'s auditory system.\n\nAlso like adults, Clarkson, Martin, and Miciek (1996) found that infants’ pitch perception decreases with a decreasing number of harmonics; harmonics are the individual bits that make up a “complex” tone such as a musical note.  Infants’ performance on pitch perception tasks indicates that they can hear the pitch of a missing fundamental in complexes that contained 3 or 5 harmonic groups, but not in complexes that contained less than 3 harmonics.  This finding indicates that the fewer harmonics in a complex, the more difficult it is for infants to perceive pitch (Clarkson et al, 1996). While this trend was also true for adults, the pitch perception performance of infants is still somewhat less developed than that of adult listeners who, unlike the 7 month olds in this study, could perceive pitch in a 2 harmonic tonal complex (Clarkson et al., 1996.) \n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:00','2012-08-22 12:30:00'),(2643,'m_4_1','Actively Responding to Music','Between the ages of three and six months, infants begin to actively respond to music more than just passively receive it.  According to a review by Hargreaves (1986), they turn towards the sound, sometimes show astonishment and actively reveal pleasure. Moog (1976) tested 500 children between the ages of three months and five years.  He found that when music is played, six month olds typically stop whatever they are doing, turn towards the source of the music, often with a look of astonishment.  They remain attentive and motionless and then often looked to their mothers smiling.  He even found that babies stop feeding to look at the source of the sounds.  Babies responded more often to songs and instrumental music as opposed to other sounds, such as mere rhythms or nonmusical sounds.

They played the notes at a rate of 2.5 notes per second and played them a total of 30 times.  The babies at first showed a response to the notes, then the infants habituated to the sound.  At this point, Chang and Trehub played a version of the song that was transposed (played up or down a minor third) or a new arrangement of the transposition so that the original melody no longer had the same contours.  Babies reacted to the new arrangement, but not to the transposition up or down a third.  This suggests that the infants perceived the altered melodic contour as new and different but perceived the transposition as undifferentiated from the notes that they had habituated to.  Hargreaves (1986) cautions that because half of Chang and Trehub’s sample never habituated to the first tune, that they did not include them in the rest of the study.  This raises questions about the subsequent findings.   \n\nIn later research, Trehub and colleagues (Trehub, Bull, & Thorpe, 1984) examined what kinds of melodic transformations infants can recognize.  They concluded that sequences with the same melodic contour and frequency range are treated as similar while those with a different contour or frequency range are treated as novel.  According to Hargreaves (1986), this finding is developmentally important in that it suggests that infants process unfamiliar music in a manner parallel to adults that involves using a global processing strategy.\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:00','2012-08-22 12:30:00'),(2646,'m_5_2','Recognizing Rhythmic Changes','Research suggests that babies as young as five months old are able to detect rhythmic changes. (Chang & Trehub, 1977).  Chang and Trehub (1977) used habituation studies to assess whether children recognized the difference between an original rhythm and one that was changed.  The babies at first showed a response to the rhythm, then they habituated to it or become bored with it.  At this point, the researchers changed the rhythm slightly to see if the infants detected the change. Infants reacted to the changed rhythm, suggesting that they perceived it as being distinct.  \n\nTrehub (1993) and colleagues used the following method to assess whether or not infants discriminate specific music features: first, they trained infants to turn towards a loudspeaker whenever they heard a change in a sound pattern.  Next, they presented a repeating melody over a loudspeaker to one side of the infant, repeating it until the infant habituated or became bored with it and resumed normal activity.  A puppet was interacting with the infant straight ahead so that the child typically would look straight on.  Then they substituted some part of a musical piece and noted if the child turned his or her head. They reinforced the turning by having an animated toy pop up near the speaker.  The parent or tester holding the child wore a set of headphones that played competing sounds.  They also ran a group of infants as a control to see how often children naturally looked to one side with no stimulus at all.\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:00','2012-08-22 12:30:00'),(2647,'m_6_1','Detecting Durational Changes in Sound','Research has determined that young infants are sensitive to the temporal aspects of sound, detecting changes in the duration of signals and silence (Morrongiello & Trehub, 1987; Trehub, Schneider & Henderson, 1995).  This ability, however, is somewhat limited and continues to develop throughout childhood (Morrongiello & Trehub, 1987; Trehub et al., 1995). These abilities are important in discriminating speech sounds and detecting certain signals in noise (Morrongiello & Trehub, 1987). The ability of infants to detect small changes in the duration of sounds suggest that they may be able to make adjustments in the individual articulation of a speaker when perceiving speech, similar to the way that adults do (Eimas & Miller, 1980, and Miller & Liberman, 1979, as cited in Morrongiello & Trehub, 1987).\n\nMorrongiello & Trehub (1987) examined the development of auditory temporal processing, described as the ability to perceive the duration of sounds and detect changes in signal and silence intervals. This ability is important in discriminating speech sounds and detecting certain signals in noise (Morrongiello & Trehub, 1987). Their findings suggest that sound duration perception increases with age, as 6 month old infants in the study were able to reliably detect durational changes in either silence or a signal of 20 millisecond (ms) duration, while preschool children performed better, detecting changes of 15 ms.  The adults in their study detected changes as small as 10 ms (Morrongiello & Trehub, 1987). \n\nSimilarly, Trehub and colleagues (1995) studied gap detection, the ability for a listener to detect an interruption in a sound, thus hearing two sounds rather than one continuous sound.  Trehub and colleagues (1995) compared the gap detection abilities of infants, 5 year-olds and adults.  An interesting finding from their study was that infants could perform almost as well as adults in detecting gaps between tone “pips”, but that they did not perform nearly as well at detecting gaps in a continuous tone.  Trehub and colleagues (1995) suggest that this finding may be attributable to infants’ quicker rate of sound adaptation and slower rate of recovery from adaptation compared to adults, making it difficult for them to detect subtle gaps in a continuous tone.  This suggests, therefore, that if infants adapt to a continuous sound more quickly and recover from it more slowly than do adults, infants may not discriminate durational changes in sound as well as adults in contexts such as a noisy conversational environment (Trehub et al., 1995).\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:00','2012-08-22 12:30:00'),(2648,'m_6_2','Exploring Ranges of Pitch','As early as six months old, babies begin to engage in vocal play that involves exploring a variety of pitches with their voices.  This play grows into musical babbling [see related window, Babbling Musically at 8 months.]  Ostwald (1973) found that infants explore the range of different sounds that they can make.  Other research shows that they will attempt to imitate sounds that they have heard (Kessen, Levine, & Wendrich, 1979; Revesz, 1954).  Kessen and colleagues taught mothers to train their infants to match a pitch that the mother played for them on a pitch pipe. After 40 days of practice, babies younger than six months old were trained to sing back pitches (the minor triad D-F-A).  The infants were successful most of the time and seemed to enjoy and work hard at the task.  The infants’ ability was independent of the parents’ musical ability.  Sloboda (1985) points out that this type of intensive training is not typical of normal enculturation. Therefore, while this offers a glimpse of what babies are capable of, it does not suggest that children under one year can imitate melodic sequences even when the sequence it as short as two notes.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:00','2012-08-22 12:30:00'),(2649,'m_7_1','Moving to Pure Sounds','Around the middle to end of the first year of life, babies start to respond to music with body movement of bouncing and rhythmic swaying (Hargreaves, 1986; Greenberg, 1979). The movements of infants to the sound of music at this time typically start soon after the music has begun and the infant has listened for a moment (Greenberg, 1979).  Their movements usually involve the entire body rather than isolated parts, and can vary from small and smooth movements to large and jerky ones (Greenberg, 1979). Although the movements of these infants may be rhythmic and steady, they generally are not coordinated with the rhythm of the music. This kind of coordination typically emerges around 24 months.  According to Hargreaves (1986), around this age infants are responding to pure sounds while around the end of the first year infants are beginning to respond to rhythmic sounds.

Six-month-old babies and adults listened to a repeating melody from either a Western or a Javanese scale, occasionally interrupted by a mistuned sequence.  Whereas the adults detected the mistuning in the Western melody more easily than the Javanese melody, the babies responded to mistuning in the Western or Javanese melodies at the same rate.  Therefore, babies seem to be born with the ability to perceive music across a variety of types of sound.  Over time, however, babies become better able to perceive types of music they hear often than to types of music they rarely or never hear.  Experience, then, affects music perception as it does language acquisition--infants are able to distinguish sounds used in speech even in foreign languages (Aslin, Pisoni, & Jusczyk, 1983), but eventually, as the infant’s ability to perceive speech is shaped by her native language, the ability to discriminate sounds in foreign languages disappears (Burnham, Earnshaw, & Clark, 1991).',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:00','2012-08-22 12:30:00'),(2651,'m_8_1','Babbling Musically ','Around 8 months of age, children begin to engage in musical babbling.  Moog (1976) draws a distinction between musical babbling and the non-musical babbling that children engage in when learning language.  Musical babbling occurs shortly after non-musical babbling.  Musical babbling occurs in response to music that the child hears.  Musical babbling, sometimes called “babbling songs”, are sounds of varied pitch produced either on one vowel or on a few syllables (Hargreaves, 1986).  Babbling songs do not resemble the music a child hears.  Instead of having a distinct rhythm, the pauses occur at the points where the child needs to breathe. The songs are not organized according to any tonal system, such as the set of major and minor scales found in Western music (Hargreaves, 1986; Scholes, 1955); instead, infants’ melodies often slide continuously from one pitch to another in a process referred to as “glissando”. \n\nHolahan (1987) studied children’s music behaviors at various ages and has identified different levels of music babbling. At the first level, which typically occurs between 8 and 9 months of age, infants react to musical stimulation by musically babbling various musical elements, such as creating pitch or tonal patterns and even moving to the sound of the music (Holahan, 1987). This level persists until preschool age, at which time children typically begin to spontaneously produce musical babble without a musical stimulus (Holahan, 1987).  It is not until children are about 5 years of age that they are capable of creating music with tonal and rhythmic patterns, a pitch center and a consistent tempo (Holahan, 1987).  At this time children are becoming aware of the relationship between the sounds and elements in music. Through formal instruction children’s musical ability becomes more sophisticated.\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:00','2012-08-22 12:30:00'),(2652,'m_8_2','Perceiving Timbre','Research on infants’ perception of complex sounds suggests that by around 8 months old, infants can attend to and discriminate between the timbre of familiar tonal sequences.  Younger infants, 2-3 months of age, are able to distinguish different timbres that play two different notes (Michel, 1973). Timbre is the distinctive quality of sound that differentiates it from other sounds of similar pitch and loudness (Trehub, Endman & Thorpe, 1990).  For instance, timbre is what differentiates a flute playing the same note and loudness as a piano. Adults conserve the distinctive qualities or timbres of vowels, consonants, or musical instruments across a wide range of pitch and loudness (see Dowling & Harwood, 1986, as cited in Trehub et al., 1990).\n\nEvidences of timbre discrimination is suggested by infants’ ability to discriminate pitch and vowel sounds (e.g., Kuhl, 1979; Swoboda, Morse & Leavitt, 1976; Trehub, 1973).  The ability of infants to discriminate between complex tones of the same pitch but different sound structure or shape, also suggests that infants may perceive and detect differences in timbre (Clarkson, Clifton & Perris, 1988; as cited in Trehub et al., 1990).  The difference between spoken vowels is the pattern of amplitude across complex tones, distinguishing “ahh” sounds from “eeeh” sounds (Trehub et al., 1990).  This pattern of amplitude variation is referred to as the shape of the spectral envelope.   \n\nThe findings of research by Trehub et al., (1990) suggest that around 7½ and 8 months of age, infants begin to discriminate complex tones on the basis of timbre, in addition to attending to other auditory cues such as pitch contour and rhythmic patterns. Infant do not however attend to individual phonetic cues in running speech, but rather to the overall frequency contour, or shape of the sounds (Fernald & Kuhl, 1987; Trehub, Thorpe, & Morrongiello, 1987; as cited in Trehub et al., 1990). The findings of Trehub et al.(1990) suggest that infants identify timbre of sound on the basis of the spectral envelope and that this may play a part in infants’ ability to distinguish between voices, particularly those of males and females early in infancy.  \n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:00','2012-08-22 12:30:00'),(2653,'m_8_3','Perceiving Musical Passages as Coherent Patterns','Researchers suggest that infants do perceive musical passages as coherent patterns (Trehub, Schellenberg, & Hill, 1997) according to research carried out primarily with eight month olds.  Trehub and colleagues (1997) suggest that there is a growing body of evidence to support this claim (1985, 1987, 1993) and offered the following examples.  First, infants categorize tones with multiple overtones on the basis of pitch as adults do (Clarkson & Clifton, 1985).  In addition, they group components of auditory sequences on the basis of similarity in pitch, timbre, and loudness (Demany, 1982; Thorpe & Trehub, 1989; Thorpe, Trehub, Morrongiello & Bull, 1988).  They also recognize multi-tone patterns across variations in tempo and pitch level (Trehub & Thorpe, 1989; Trehub, Thorpe, & Morrongiello, 1987).  Infants also perceive timbral similarity of complex tones despite variations in pitch, loudness, and duration (Trehub, Endman, & Thorpe, 1990).  Trehub and colleagues (1997) argue that these factors are the ones that provide a sense of coherence to musical patterns for adults and children.  Thus, they argue that infants do perceive musical passages as coherent patterns.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:00','2012-08-22 12:30:00'),(2654,'m_9_1','Attending to Rhythm','Around the end of the first year, babies begin to respond to the rhythmic aspects of music by bouncing, swaying and “dancing” (Hargreaves, 1986).  In testing 500 children from age 6 months to 5 years, Moog (1976) found that while nearly all babies made some movements in response to different types of music (such as swaying side to side or bouncing up and down), between the ages of 9 months to one year these behaviors increased in frequency, intensity, and duration. \n\nAs children get older, around 18 months of age, they increasingly attempt to match their rhythmic movements to the music that they hear.  The kinds of movements that they engage in when responding to movement increases dramatically around this time (Hargreaves, 1986).  According to Hargreaves (1986), characteristic movements include nodding their heads, seesawing on one foot, raising and lowering their heels, and moving their knees back and forth.. Coordinating music and movement is still a challenge and while children do attempt to match their movements to those in the music and will try to “dance” with others, they can’t do it for very long.  Moog (1976) found that children 18-24 months old could match their movements to the rhythm of music for short periods of time.  The length of time increased with age, but children reach a plateau between the third and fourth years.  The length of time with for which children can sustain such efforts improves with age, though not markedly in the next couple of years (Moog, 1976). \n\nInfants also engage in behaviors that appear to hold rhythmic intention, however, this may be over-interpreting what they are doing.  Sloboda (1985) gives the example of his daughter at eight months of age banging her spoon and repeating nonsense syllables in her babbling.  He argues, however that these do not fit what he would set as a definition for rhythmic intention.  He defines rhythmic intention as involving the following behaviors: “a) subdivision of a beat, so that sometimes there are two or more events within a regular superordinate pulse; b) omission of a beat, with the picking up of the pulse at the correct time after a pause; c) imitation of a given rhythmic pattern; d) moving or beating in time to music.” (pg. 201).  \n\nThe recognition of changes in rhythm is available in infancy (Chang & Trehub, 1977) and young children can imitate rhythms.  By around three years of age, children are just beginning to be able to clap or tap in a steady pattern for a very brief period (Williams, Sievers, & Hattwick, 1933). In part it depends upon what children are trying to duplicate.  When duplicating speech rhythms or tapping a regular rhythm, three years olds fared better than when clapping rhythms (Rainbow, 1977; Rainbow & Owen, 1979). According to Moorehead and Pond (1978), children’s earliest spontaneously generated patterns tend to be regular, unaccented and monotonous. Over time irregular accents begin to show up. By the time children are four and five, they are beginning to be able to duplicate short rhythmic patterns (Zenatti, 1976, as cited in Hargreaves, 1986).  On the ability to represent rhythm through standard notation, the youngest children (age 4) reflected the action of their clapping--paralleling development in drawing (Bamberger, 1982).\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:00','2012-08-22 12:30:00'),(2655,'m_9_2','Revealing Displeasure with Certain Music ','While babies begin to reveal pleasure in response to certain pieces of music at a much earlier age, around nine months of age, they begin to reveal their displeasure as well.  Moog (1976) tested 500 children between the ages of three months and five years.  He played six different types of tests: 1) three nursery songs sung by children; 2) word spoken to distinct rhythms but without a precise pitch; 3) pure rhythms played on various percussion instruments and combinations thereof; 4) instrumental music; 5) tonally consonant items from the instrumental music in test 4 rewritten so that it was harmonically dissonant; and 6) nonmusical sounds including the sounds of traffic and a vacuum cleaner.  Nine month olds actively revealed their displeasure with the noise and rhythm tapes.  They pulled away, made dissatisfied faces, and even revealed signs of fear.  Babies responded with signs of pleasure to songs and instrumental music (tests 1, 4, and 5) as opposed to the other sounds, such as mere rhythms or nonmusical sounds.  In every case, the babies responded to either instrumental music or nursery songs if they responded to one category.  If it was two categories, it was those two, and in the case of more than two, it always included instrumental music and nursery songs.  Sloboda (1985) suggests that babies are responding to the quality of sounds and that they attended to those that involved smooth treble-register pitched sounds.

For example, one study indicated that infants were more likely to turn their heads to the right when hearing speech and turn their heads to the left when hearing music (Young & Gagnon, 1990).  However, when researching the specific components of melody, musical changes which altered the contour of the melody were more easily recognized when they were presented to the infant’s left ear.  Similarly, infants who heard musical changes where the overall contour was preserved did so more when it was presented to the right ear.  This same pattern of asymmetries was witnessed with a different group of infants, using different melodies (Balaban et al., 1998).  \n\nThese findings can perhaps help address subsequent listening strategies for adults, for earlier studies report a right-ear perceptual dominance for musicians and a left-ear perceptual dominance for non-musicians with regards to identifying musical patterns (Bever & Chiarello, 1974).\n\nDuring the first year of life, children can begin to notice a change in the contour of a given melody.  Children at five months have been known to recognize melodic contour.  In addition, studies have found differences in how infants process speech versus music.  At 10-11 months, infants are able to detect general changes in melodic contour, regardless of interval size or frequency of the pitches (Trehub et al., 1987).  Additionally, recent research appears to indicate differences in perception regarding infants’ ability to recognize the specific characteristics of contour (Balaban et al., 1998).

For example, infants have been shown to perceive changes in musical transformations, including changes in key signature, pitch intervals within preserved contour, and octave changes within changed contour.  At five months of age, infants are able to further perceive changes in melodic contour in atonal melodies.  Researchers concluded that infants consider melodies to be “the same” or “familiar” if the contour is preserved, and consider melodies to be “new” if they alter range or contour in some manner (Zimmerman, 1993).\n\nTrehub, Bull, and Thorpe (1984) investigated infants’ ability to detect changes in the repetitions of a 6-tone sequence.  Infants indicated an ability to discriminate all transformations from the original musical sequence.  Yet, it has been suggested that this “global” ability to process melodic transformations can perhaps help predict the infant’s specific contour-processing strategy.  For example, the more closely the transformations preserved the actual melodic contour, the more difficult is was for the infant to detect the transposition or key change.\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:00','2012-08-22 12:30:00'),(2658,'l_12_1','Symbolic Gesturing ','By the end of the first year, infants gesture as they speak.  They intentionally produce gestures of pointing, giving and showing, as well as an assortment of gestures that are embedded in routines such as “wave bye-bye”.  For at least some infants, these readily understood gestures are consistently combined with protowords to lend meaning to the vocalization.  But gestures are not merely a temporary support for vocalizations.  Like vocalizations, gestures undergo a transformation towards symbolization, becoming both increasingly conventionalized and decontextualized.  Gesturing becomes increasingly representational.(Pettito, 1990 as cited in Sroufe, 1994) [See Related Language LW- 9 Months- The Emergence of Communicative Gestures: Instrumental Gesturing]. At about 12 to 13 months of age, infants typically begin to communicate spontaneously using symbolic gestures (Acredolo and Goodwyn, 1990), e.g. gestural requests such as knob turning for “I want to go out”; gestural names such as sniff for “flower” or panting for “dog”; and attributes, such as blowing for “hot”.  Gesturing increases a lot between 10-18 months and begins to decrease around 24 months as children are gaining new words to help them communicate (Lock et al, 1990).  By the middle of this second year, verbalizations begin to dominate over gestures as infants begin increasingly to use a vocal label instead of a naming gesture\n',NULL,'Representational Gestures: Hillary points to and bangs on the cracker drawer when she is hungry.','Bill notices that his daughter Hillary bangs on the drawer where he keeps crackers with the flat of\nher hand.

The response does not necessarily show the correct relationship.(Benedict, 1976).  At 17 months, even before the two-word stage, children understand some things about word order and can make sense of multiword utterances.  (Golinkoff & Hirsh-Pasek, 1987; Golinkoff, Hirsh-Pasek, Cauley, & Gordon, 1987). Benedict (1976) outlined 4 stages that children go through in achieving understanding: 1) the ability to respond to a few terms in particular game-like contexts (peekaboo, patty-cake, thank-you); 2) the ability to respond to a number of words that aren\'t necessarily spoken in context; 3) the ability to respond to more than one word in a sentence. The response does not necessarily show the correct relationship; 4) more than one term in correct relationship.  Children\'s understanding tends to go from context-bound to context-free (Huttenlocher, 1974)--understanding in situations where the word refers to something that is present versus understanding references to objects that are not present.  Children tend to understand action words early (Benedict, 1976; Huttenlocher, 1974; Nelson, 1973) but the words they produce tend to be object words (shoe, dog, toy).  \n\nChildren\'s ability to understand words is generally believed to precede their ability to generate them.   However, there was some research to suggest that kids learned to understand at about the same time as they learned to produce (Roberts, 1983) or even later (e.g. Chapman, 1977)  Recent research supports the view that kids do understand more than they can produce.  Reznick and Goldfield (1992) found that many (but not all) children experience a spurt in their comprehension vocabulary.  Although it sometimes occurs as early as 14 months, it is more likely to occur between 20 and 22 months of age.  Infants tend to experience spurts in their receptive and productive vocabulary at about the same time.  Although the available data are still sparse, they establish early language comprehension as an organized process.  Further, research suggests that although comprehension may precede production, it may be mediated by common cognitive advances.  A number of research studies have supported this (Fraser, Bellugi & Brown, 1963; Huttenlocher, 1973; Sachs & Truswell, 1978). \n',NULL,'Eduardo comprehends \"Dada, bye bye\", when his father drops him off at day care.','Eduardo has been dropped of at his day care center by his father, Juan, for several months now. \nThey have developed a \"good bye\"routine to try and ease the transition from Juan\'s arms to that \nof his daytime caretaker.  [link to separation anxiety and day care issues here].  Part of this routine\nis that Juan prepares Eduardo in the car while they are driving to the center by going over what will\nhappen during the day.  For example, \"first we will put your bag into your cubby, then Dada will say\nbye bye, then you will play with the blocks, then it is lunch time.

The timing, content and function of symbolic gestures are remarkably similar to concurrent verbal vocabularies according to Acredolo and Goodwyn (1990).  However by the middle of the second year of life, infants become increasingly likely to produce a vocal label rather than a naming gesture (Bretherton et al. 1981).  Around 17-18 months old, children develop the ability to look in the direction that someone is pointing even if the person is looking a different way.  This shows that they are able to coordinate the divergent gestural information and visual information.  This ability tends to appear about the same time as real words (Masur, 1990).  Children can look in the direction that someone else is pointing at earlier ages (around 12 months) if the person is looking in the direction that they are pointing (Lempers, Flavell & Flavell, 1977)  As children get older, gestures are not simply discarded as a form of communication.  They remain as elaborators and augmentors of speech which clarify failed requests.  As Greenfield and Smith (1976) point out, children are able to communicate because they are not dependent solely on words but use their words with gestures, action and intonation, within a context they share with their listener.  By three years old, children integrate gestures and language as part of the same message.

In some cases children will over-extend a word.  This means using it to cover more uses than it does.  A common example is when children use the word \"doggie\" to refer to all kinds of four-legged animals or when children refer to all vehicles as \"trucks.\"  Some researchers have suggested that children do this as they try to get a lot of meaning out of a few words or that the child may realize that the word is not or at least might not be the right one, but uses it because he or she has no other word (Bloom, 1973; Kuczaj, 1982).  Some of the overgeneralizations are common to many children (calling a cow, \"doggie\"), others are personalized (a child calling helicopter toys \"beanies\" because they have a similar propeller to his beanie hat).  Another characteristic way that children use first words is to underextend words.  In this case, children assume the word to refer to one thing only.  For instance, \"car\" to refer only to their red car, or \"store\" to refer only to the store where they go.  Research suggests that parents may encourage overextending to some extent as they offer children the most basic nouns to label things.(Mervis & Mervis, 1982)  As children make finer and finer discriminations, parents are likely to offer labels with finer distinctions.    \n',NULL,'Alicia insists that only her calico cat is a \"cat\".','Alicia correctly points to or pats her calico cat when her mother Susan asks her, \"where is the cat?\". \nShe has been attempting to say \"cat\" (it comes out \"ca\").

This is a common occurrence in the acquisition of\nexpressive language, and is called \"under generalization\", where words are too narrowly defined by \nchildren.\n','A related phenomenon is that of \"over generalization\", where words are too broadly defined.  For\nexample, if Alicia had said \"ca\", when she saw a dog, this would be called over generalization.  In\nher mind, perhaps Alicia thinks of \"cat\" as a four legged furry pet.  This can go so far as all four\nlegged furry animals, and even cows or pigs might be labeled, \"ca\".  Both over  and under\ngeneralization are not uncommon patterns of development, and simply reflect a child\'s understanding\nof certain words.  These are stages that #Nickname# may pass through during #his/her# journey towards\nexpressive language acquisition. You may find that in addition to overgeneralizing #Nickname# may also\nbecome rigid in #his/her# expectations when #he/she# hears a certain sound.  This is normal.

This marks the child\'s first use of syntax--the ways that sentences are constructed following certain rules. (Tager-Flusberg, 1989).  Around this time, parents hear children saying things like, \"no more,\" \"kitty gone,\" \"all dirty.\"   While these sentences are simple, they are systematic.  Many of the words in two word sentences are nouns, verbs, and adjectives, what are called open-class or content words.  Missing are words such as prepositions, conjunctions, articles, pronouns, auxiliaries, and inflections--what are called closed-class words or functors (Tager-Flusberg, 1989)  Children\'s early sentences are often called telegraphic.  They sound like telegrams because they leave out the least important words. (Brown & Fraser, 1963)   There are common forms that two word sentences tend to take.  These include  location + name (there toy); negation (no want; no dirty) (examples adapted from Slobin, 1979; as cited in Hetherington & Parke, 1986)  agent + action (daddy go; mommy sit); action  + object (eat cookie; go car); agent + object (baby sock; dog food); action + location (go home); entity + location (cookie table); possessor + possession (my toy; daddy car); entity + attribute (cake big; shoe dirty); and demonstrative + entity (dat kitty; dis toy).

[See Related Language LW- 30 month- A Second Dramatic Vocabulary Explosion.]  This spurt is more obvious in certain children (whom researchers call referential children) than in others (whom researchers call expressive children) (Goldfield, & Reznick, 1990).  Katherine Nelson found that, for most children, many of these early words will be nouns--objects that are familiar to them and that they can act upon, for example, \"dog,\" \"cookie,\" \"blocks.\"  However, for some children -- those who tend to be more socially inclined -- their early words are likely to be more abstract and associated with getting attention or making commands.  For instance, they are more likely to use words like \"stop it,\" \"I want it,\" \"wow\" or \"cool.\"(Nelson, 1981)  Parents often help children learn new words by labeling objects \"(adult to child: Is that a teddy bear?  Is that a funny teddy bear you have?\"), using words in context (adult to child: \"Here\'s a cup of milk.\"), or offering words to help children think about and symbolize their experience (adult to child: \"You look like you\'re feeling mad.  Are you feeling mad about what happened?\") \n\nResearch shows that children\'s acquisition of new words follows certain patterns (Nelson, 1981)  For many children, most of their new words are general nominals.  These include words such as \"ball\" or \"dog.\"  Children tend to master words such as these before they learn superordinates (animals) or subordinates (collie) (Gopnik & Meltzoff, 1992; Mervis, Mervis, Johnson & Bertrand, 1992).  Children\'s new words also represent specific nominals, such as mommy, daddy, grandma, or grandpa, though these make up a much smaller percentage of children\'s total vocabulary.  Other words include action words (such as \"bye, bye,\" \"give,\" or \"stop\"), modifiers (such as \"blue,\" \"big,\"or \"dirty\"), personal social words (such as \"no\" or \"please\") and function words (such as \"where,\" \"do\", and \"for\").   These categories represent much smaller percentages of children\'s words than words such as \"ball\" and \"dog.\"  \n\nThe rapid growth in children\'s language learning between one and two corresponds to certain physical changes in the cortex of the brain (Lecours, 1975).  The brain goes through three  myelogenetic cycles--the second one beginning at birth and continuing until three and a half to four and a half.

Because there is a profound reorganization of thought at the end of the second year, the child now gains new insight into the limitlessness of word assignment and realizes that there is a word for every concept (Gopnick & Meltzoff, 1992). Developmentalists point out that this is an important realization given that children begin not even knowing that words exist (Sroufe, Cooper, & DeHart, 1992).  As kids hear things being labelled and begin using those labels, they begin to learn that things have a name and at some point, the recognition that everything must have a name dawns on them.  Around this time, children use their developing questioning skills to repeatedly seek out new labels and at times may appear to badger their parents with \"whatdat?\"  Along with children\'s increasing growth in memory and ability to understand representation, this recognition helps to drive their vocabulary growth spurt.  Once children have made this connection and begin to connect many words with their labels, over-extensions (the tendency to use one word to refer to many related objects, for instance doggie for cows, horses, cats, etc.) begin to diminish.  By age two and a half, overextensions tend to disappear.','Mike says \" Apple ! \" ','Naming and asking in one word','Mike goes into the kitchen.  His mother is unpacking the groceries, putting them in their usual places.  When his mother puts the apples into a hanging wire basket, Mike says, \"Apple.\"  His mother is pleased and says, \"Yes, it is an apple.\"  Mike is not so pleased.  He repeats with more stress, \"APPLE!\"  His mother understands and replies, \"Oh, you would like an apple.  Let me wash and slice it for you.\"','Since there was no particular urgency in Mike\'voice the first time he said \"apple\" we can presume that he was simply speeking the name to indicate that he recognized the object and knows its name.  However, when the apple is not offered, his urgency increases.  Even though he uses the same word, he uses different stress patterns to incidate his desire.  It is quite possible that his desire to have the apple was a consequence of speaking its name and did not \"hit\" him when he first saw the apple.  The sight of the apple plus hearing his own utterance of its name could have combined to create a better connection with his past experience with the apple, and from that, created the desire to have it.  Language can create desire as well as represent desire that comes before speaking.  ','#first# will both name objects and request objects in many situations.  Pay particular attention to the first use of a word.  First uses might come\n\n· Immediately after hearing you name a new object\n· Immediately after seeing the new object for the second time\n· Upon entering the room or area where #he/she# first learned the word\n\n#first# is most open to learning new words when the object has some special attribute, such as\n· the object moves in an unexpected way\n· the object has some little appendage or hole that attracks #first#.\n· the object is slightly out of reach, but not unobtainable\n· the object is revealed after being partially hidden \n','Once #first# gets the idea that each object has a name #he/she# will want to know what it is.  On most occasions you can just answer #his/her# questions.  When #he/she# asks \"What\'s dat?\" you say, #This is a xxx.\"  On other occasions, when you think #first# may be able, you follow #his/her# question with, \"You name it, o.k.?\"  You may be pleased to hear some of #first#\'s invented words.  For example, he may ask about a swan he sees guilding over the pond, and answer you with the new name \"water bird.\"  On other ocassions you might answer as in the following example.   \"I think we have see this before,  Remember at Grandmaw\'s house when you hurt your knee.  We call this a .....(it is a band aid). \"  See if #first# can provide the name.  Most of the times, however, you will simply oblige #his/her# request and provide the name slowly and clearly, and perhaps add some additional information about the object\'s appearance or function.','\"There\'s \'Donalds!\"','#first# tries to name something','Imagine a situation where #first# has either asked you \"what\'s that?\" of has offered #his/her# approximation of an object\'s name, such as \"There\'s \'donalds\" when #he/she# sees the golden arches of MacDonalds.  #first#\'s interest in a name can come at any time, but will be common when there is some excitement in the air, like seeing new things on a trip or at a friend\'s house.','The most important response is to acknowledge that you are listening.  One way to do this, and to support #first#\'s language development to boot, is to add some context to #his/her# requested or provided word.  In the first case, \"It\'s a sled, for sliding down a hilll of snow.\"   In the second case, \"So it is, the place were we go to eat sometimes.\"   ','If #first# for some reason is not asking or giving names in a situation where #he/she# usually does, you might gently probe to see if #he/she# picks up on your frame of mind.  Say something like, \"I remember seeing this yesterday (referring to the hammer on the workbench), but I can\'t remember it\'s name.\"  Try to make such suggestions as natural as possible, such as, situations where you are using something or doing something that has a name you want your child to offer.  Or you can simple provide your child with two choices for breakfast and ask \"Which one do you want?\"   If #he/she# points, look away or ask the question the first time with your head buried in a cabinet or refrigerator so you child will know that #he/she# has to use words since you can not see #him/her# point.   The objective here is to support #first#\'s knowing when a name is needed and not simply what the correct name is.','You will discover that #first# will ask about the names of objects, including printed letters.  Printed letters to a young child are also objects.   So when #first# asks you \"what\'s that\" when he points to the double M\'s outside of MacDonalds and you say, \"That\'s MacDonalds, the place we eat.\" #he/she# will probably think about these Ms as a part of the building and not as alphabet  letters.  Gradually you can help #first# distinguish between the name of objects and the names of letters, which themselves refer to sounds.  But this comes later and there is no need to rush learning to read.','Naming is a social contract among members of a common language that facilitates communication and improves the effectiveness of collaborative work.  By keeping the \"naming game\" centered in the pragmatics of getting things done, you will be helping #first# learn how to figure out something\'s name and how to recognize when a name is needed instead of a gesture or a general word such as \"thing\" or \"what\'sa-ya-call-it.\"  ','The Sound of a Clock','Naming Pictures in Magazines','On those occasions where you are reading a magazine notice to see if #first# is interested in the pictures.  Some magazines have great photos of items that #first# will recognize.  These are probably not the wide angle shots of the Tanzania plains in the National Geographic but more likely will be those photos of more familiar scenes and objects, such as a kitchen scene in Better Homes and Gardens.  ','Let\'s say that #first# has noticed an object, perhaps a wall clock, in a photograph and utters the words #he/she# knows,  \"c\'ock.\"  At a minimum you now know that #first# sees a familiar form in the printed page.  Your response should gently expand #his/her# thoughts.  \"A clock, yes, it makes a special sound.  Can you make the same sound that the clock makes.\"  It will be useful to make this distinction between \"tell me the sound\" and \"can you make the sound.\"  Telling, as a rule, usually refers to speaking words rather than imitating noises and sounds.','If #first# does not seem to understand your question, go ahead and model the answer.  \"Tick tock, tick tock or maybe click clack, click clack.  Which one sounds more like the clock to you?\"  Here you are giving #first# a choice and at the same time communicating that an imitation of a sound could be a matter of choice rather than a dictionary pronunciation of a word. ','At their best naming games should never be played completely in isolation of some meaningful social context.  In the above case you were reading a magazine as is usual for you at that time of day.   Other situations can occur where more advanced naming is just as meaningful.  For example, say you and #first# are at the zoo and there are animals #first# has never seen before.  Here is an opportunity for you to invent names.  \"Well it (the hippopotamus) looks like a big horse in the water.  We could call it a \"water horse\" .  Offer a few of these ideas and see if #first# will come up with a few of #he/she# own.  ','Names are convenient tags we use in order to express our meanings in a quick and effective way.  Yet a name is just the beginning to a complete thought.  By asking #first# to remember or infer other attributes of the object or event that was named, you are helping #first# organize and index #his/her# knowledge.  An indexed knowledge base is a more useful knowledge base.

While it has not been widely written about or even widely studied, it seems to be a phenomenon that many parents have noticed.  Linguist George Miller points out that A.A. Milne writes about children\'s nighttime soliloquies in one of his books (though the observation belongs to Miller\'s wife, not Miller himself) (Miller, 1962)  Researchers such as Ruth Weir (1962) and Katherine Nelson (1983, 1989) have studied children\'s pre-sleep speech for both form and content as well as to try to understand its purpose.  Katherine Nelson studied one child\'s \"crib monologues\" in depth to consider how these verbalizations represented children\'s growing understanding of the world in relation to language development (Nelson, 1983, 1989).  The earliest crib talk appeared to be a combination of free associations and were difficult to translate given their inarticulate nature.  As children get older and grow to understand  concepts having to do with past, present, and future, the monologues appear to be a means of thinking about what happened and about things that might happen.  Around two years of age, Nelson found that the pattern of the monologues changed and now they provided an opportunity to work through problems, talking things through and thinking about what to do.  The monologues sometimes involved working through inconsistencies that the child had witnessed, making sense of things that she learned and things that she already knew.  The progression of the monologues indicated that language can provide a means for children to think about and make sense of their world with the increasing complexity brought by new concepts that they are learning.  These monologues illustrate that speech is not just a socially communicative function in young children.  There is a playful repetition that suggests the child is practicing. It is speech to oneself.  There is a certain automaticity to them that reveals the child\'s unsupported level of understanding.     \n\nCrib monologues are one form of private speech that young children engage in.  Often children practice language constructions, construct dialogues, ask and answer questions and so forth (Labov & Labov, 1978).  According to Ruth Weir, bedtime speech can also be a time to practice rhyme, alliteration, and onomatopoeia (Weir, 1962).  Personal monologues continue to be common throughout the toddler and preschool years.  It is not uncommon for a group of preschoolers to play near each other, each carrying on a separate conversation with themselves in the context of their play.  The resulting hub-bub of conversation has been referred to as a \"collective monologue.\"   ','Tyler talks alone','Crib monologues and private speech','Tyler is playing alone on his bed.  He is talking quitely to his stuffed racoon Rocky.  \"You\'re bad.\"  He hides Rocky under the pillow.  \"I stop.  I get in seat.\"   He moves Rocky to the top of his pillow.  \"Go now.  Seat done.\"  He leaves Rocky on the pillow while he repeats these few sentences one more time.  ','Tyler is re-enacting a scene from his day where his father got angry at him for taking too long to settle down in his car seat.  Eventually, Tyler did settle down so his father could fasten the seat belts in his car seat.  Talking to himself helped Tyler remember the details of the situations and to relive the completion of the problem where he did settly down.  Reliving the completion in words helps Tyler reduce the anxious feelings he had when his father was angry.  ','Talking alone can occur anytime that #first# is feeling comfortable and unguarded.  ##His/her## thoughts just bubble to the surface like day dreams you can hear.   These occasions include\n· Talking to #himself/herself# while in the bath tub\n· Talking to #himself/herself#while in the bed, just after lights out\n· Talking to #himself/herself#while rideing alone in the back of the car\n· Talking to #himself/herself#at a familiar group setting when #he/she# is not the center of attention.\n','You can learn a lot about children when you hear them talk to themselves.  You might learn that #first# has observed something from the morning\'s events that you had not regarded as important.  You might hear #first# reveal #his/her# attitude toward an event, such as a monolog about being cold or going too fast on a sled.  The teachable moment is not when you overhear these monologs, but later when #first# is once again experiencing the event #he/had# talked about.  At those times you will find that you can make a better connection with #first# and share the experience better if you use some of the phrases you heard #first# say during #his/her# monolog.  For example, if you heard #him/her# say during #his/her# monolog, \"It is brrrr cold,\" use that expression the next time you are out of doors in the cold and you see #him/her# brace against the wind.  Language will develop naturally as #first# learns how words can provide continuity to experiences that happen over different times.  \n','Watch Your Mouth','Mirror in the crib during private speech','#first# is likely to talk to #himself/herself# the most when #he/she# is most comfortable and alone, such as in the bed or crib.  To enhance these moments, place a safe mirror in a position where #first# can see #his/her# face.  Attach the mirror so #first# does not have to hold it, but can look into it at will.','Listen to #first# to hear if #he/she# begins to talk to #himself/herself#.  Pay particular attention to any words that sound like a reference to #himself/herself#.  At those moments, notice if #first# is looking in the mirror when talking.  ','The mirror alone may not provoke a monologue.  Add some familiar object from the events of the day.  For example, if you and #first# had been playing together earlier with the hand puppets, place #his/her# favorite puppet near by.   Introduce it is some way that connects to #first#\'s recent memory, such as, \"Here is Pop, the puppet that you said was old.\"  Then receed in the background in hopes that \"first\" will start to relive that encounter in his own words.','Private speech sounds more and more like ordinary speech as #first# matures.  You may even hear #him/her# assume two different voices for two different characters in a pretend dialogue.  If so, think about how you could assume one of those voices later when you and #first# are playing side by side some pretend situation.  ','Private speech gives #first# a chance to practice the way that speech sounds without having the pressure or constraints of actually communicating with another person.   This means that #first# might invent new ways to express the same sentence by varying the volume, intonations,  pauses, and inflections.  Upon hearing these variations, some will be interesting to #first# and #he/she# might decide to use the new ways of speaking in true dialogues with others.  ','Hand goes in can','Giving voice to #first# own thoughts','If you have never noticed #first# talk to #him/her# do not think that #first# has missed an important stage of development.  Some children do, some children don\'t.  But you might notice moments of playfulness with sounds when #first# is alone and perhaps you are curious if a playfulness with words is just around the corner.  If so, you might get #first# started by being #first#\'s own voice.  ','In a quite and gentle voice, almost as if you are speaking #first#\'s thoughts, describe something that #first# is doing.  Try to avoid the personal pronouns of I, you, or my.  Also avoid sentences that sound like a request.  Just say, \"Hand in can, hand goes in can.\"  If you say \"You put your hand in the can\" #first# will look at you as if you are trying to tell #him/her# something. If you say, \"Put hand in can.\" first might think you want #him/her# to do that.  But if you just describe #first#\'s current action without mention of who is doing it, #first# is more likely to let your words give voice to the action itself.   Let your words sound like the mind talking to the muscles, \"Hand opens to pick up can, hand opens, opens wide.\"   Do not try to engage #first# socially.  Try to speak #his/her# thoughts with the expectation that #first# will eventually speak #his/her# thoughts out loud #himself/herself#.  ','If #first# continually orients to you as if you are trying to communicate with #him/her#, rather than trying to give voice to #his/her# thoughts, then perhaps you should stop talking this way.  It is a rather unnatural way to talk to your own child anyway, even if it does have some educational value.  But if you think #first# is almost at the point where your words are being assimilated as #his/her# own thoughts, then continue by lowering your voice even more and pacing your voice even more exactly to the acts that your are describing.  Try this unusual, noncommunicative speech only at a time when #first# is lost in #his/her# own thoughts, is alert, but not trying to communicate with you.  ','You might notice that #first# begins to talk outloud about #his/her# own actions.  \"Pour juice, I pour juice in cup.\"  Or #first# might describe something done in the past, \"Run, run, I run from bad dog.\"  Treat these utterances as private speech and not as an attempt to engage you.  #first# is more likely connecting #his/her# current thoughts to the flow of a current action or to the memory of an event.  Refrain from recasting these utterances.  Log them in your record book or send them on to Parent Partners.  Study them from a developmental perspective.  Which utterances are simply sound play, \"go to store, store, door, the store door\"  Which utterances are filling in a grammatical slot, \"go to store, go to bed, go to car.\"    See if you have an intuition about the feature of language with which #first# is playing.','Speaking in solitude is #first#\'s way of studying the structure of language independent of function.  You might say it is a type of self regulated drill.  On the other hand, speaking outloud alone can also be a way to gain more precise control of an ongoing action, such as saying \"stop cup\" when #first# wants to pour just the right amount of liquid from a cup into a container.  The words sort of give #first# an added measure of alertness for the forthcoming need to turn #his/her# wrist in the opposite direction when the container is full.  At this age, speaking outloud can assist #first# inhibit an action in progress rather than allow the action to stimulate itself and continue beyond some critical point, e.g. overflowing the container.','2012-08-22 12:30:10','2012-08-22 12:30:10'),(2666,'l_24_1',' Fast Mapping the Meanings of New Words','\nChildren\'s generative (ability to produce) and receptive (ability to understand) language grows at a dramatic pace over the next five years.  Recall that around eighteen months old (and ranging from 15-21 months), many children go through a naming explosion (Gopnik, & Meltzoff, 1987; Bloom, Lifter, & Broughton,  1985).  This spurt corresponds with their increasing ability to form categories, understanding that objects are permanent, and increasing ability to use insight to solve means-end problems.  Children tend to experience another spurt in generative language at around 2 and 1/2. [See Related Language LW- 30 month- A Second Dramatic Vocabulary Explosion.]  What about their ability to understand word meanings--their receptive language development--in particular?  Children\'s receptive language outpaces their ability to produce words.  There is a great deal of overlap between what they can understand and what they can say.  Generally, children can understand words that they can generate.  However, there are instances when children have been able to use a word and yet not understand it when others have used it (Rice, 1983), perhaps suggesting that they haven\'t figured out the contexts to which the word is applicable or the entirety of its meaning.  By two years of age, most children have a large receptive vocabulary meaning that they can understand many different words even if they cannot generate them (Bates, Thal, Whitesell, Fenson, & Oakes, 1989).  Estimates suggest that by the time kids reach six years old, they have learned to understand (though not necessarily use) an approximate 22 words per day (Miller, 1981).  How are they learning to understand the meanings of so many words?  Research shows that beginning as young as two and into the next three years, children engage in a process known as \"fast-mapping\" (Carey, 1978; Heibeck, & Markman, 1987). Through the profound reorganization of thought at the end of the second year, the child now gains new insight into the limitlessness of word assignment and realizes that there is a word for every concept (Gopnik & Meltzoff, 1992).  This insight allows the child to fast map novel words to categories for which the child does not yet have a name e.g. If a father says, “give me the wrench” to a child at this stage, who sees both a hammer she knows and a new tool she has never seen before, will correctly infer that the wrench refers to the as- yet-unnamed referent (Mervis, Mervis, Johnson, & Bertrand, 1992).  By now, children\'s receptive language has grown sufficiently so that they are able to use context to help them make quick and fairly accurate guesses as to what words mean.  When given a sentence with unfamiliar words, children are able to figure out what the word refers to based on what they know about the other words in the sentence.  Other researchers suggest that children also use a process of comparison or \"lexical contrast\" to figure out what words mean.  If the child has heard a word applied in three or four contexts, he or she can use clues as to what was similar between the contexts to ascertain what the word means (Barrett, 1978, 1986; Clark, 1988, 1990; Markman, 1984, 1987).\n\nThe rapid growth in children\'s language learning corresponds to certain physical changes in the cortex of the brain (Lecours, 1975).  The brain goes through three  myelogenetic cycles--the second one beginning at birth and continuing until three and a half to four and a half.  Myelin is a coating that forms around the nerve endings to help make the nervous system function accurately and quickly. ','Cassie links word to tape','Fast mapping the meaning of new words','Cassie comes into the room and sees the light flashing on the VCR from a power outage last night.  \"This, this, this,\" she says to her father.  Her father thinks that she means that she wants the video tape casette that is laying on top of the VCR. He says, \"Oh, no, you can\'t have the tape.  I have to take it back to the store.\"  Cassie goes over to the tape, points directly at it and says, \"Tape?\" Her father once again assumes she has made a request and says, \"That\'s right.  I need to leave the tape where it is.\"','It is amazing that Cassie was able to abstract the little black rectangle on top of the VCR and link that object to the word \"tape\" that was one from among about 15 other words that her father uttered.  This is particularly amazing given that the video tape casette was not her focus as her father was talking.  Cassie was thinking about the flashing numbers on the VCR.  Cassie has demonstrated that she can use phrase such as \"you can\'t have ....\" as a context that means the last word is 1) an object and 2) probably an object that she could lift (but has been told not to).  She eliminates the VCR itself because it does not fit the category of a liftable object.  She reasons that her father must be talking about that cute little black casette with the picture label.  She repeats his word as she points to the tape, as if to ask for confirmation that this is the referent of the new word \"tape.\"\nOther Occurrences\n\nMost probably #first#\'s receptive language has grown sufficiently so that #he/she# is able to use context to help #him/her# make quick and fairly accurate guesses as to what words mean.  Here are some instances where you might notice a fairly quick understanding of a new word.\n\n· When the new word in heard in a sentence with familiar words, e.g. \"rotten\" is first heard in the sentence, \"Don\'t touch that stinky, rotten apple.\"\n· When the new word means the opposite of a familiar word, e.g.  #first# hears you say the new word \"sluggish\" when it is clear that you want the person to be fast.\n· When the new word refers to an action that is very conspicuous in the immediate situation, e.g. \"Be careful, the boat is bobbing!\" when the boat is pitching to and fro as a powerboat\'s wake upsets your fishing boat. \n· When a new word is mentioned just at the point when #first# expresses the meaning of that word, e.g. \"I think we are all a little frustrated here\" when #first# has just expressed a degree of anger.  \n',NULL,'Naming things is a game that #first# will discover and like to play.  At first you will begin the game with calls to attention such as \"what\'s that?\"  You will probably begin with reference to whole objects, such as an entire \"kangaroo\" at the zoo or a huge airplane going over head.  You will find your own tolerance for #first#\'s partial answers.  At first any approximation will be o.k. for an answer.  But as #first# grows older you will probably wait for a better answer or provide #him/her# with a correction.  Eventually you will call #his/her# attention to more subtle things, such as the part of an object like a handle or knob.   At some point you should notice and support a shift in the role of who asks for a name.  #first# will begin the game with a rather direct question, \"what\'s that.\"  But as you both grow in familiarity with your personal routines for this game, you will develop special methods of checking for mutual attention and a shared reference.  One example might be a certain intonation of your name, which means, \"I want to know something.\"  These are teachable moments because they express #first# is open to new information.  Take a moment to notice what #first# is noticing, what #he/she# is manipulating at the time and then build your games of naming around those items already in #first#\'s range of attention.','Where\'s the Refrigerator','Finding an object with an unfamiliar name','There will be moments that you are writing something down and #first# will notice you writing.  If #first# is curious about what you are writing, take a moment and tell #him/her# what you are writing, say, a grocery list or a reminder of what you have to do or a note to #his/her# caregiver or sitter.   See if this situation presents an opportunity for #first# to use #his/her# skills at figuring out the meaning of a new word from the context of the other words in the writing.  Read #first# on of the sentences, for example, in a note to his sitter \"Please take out the milk from the refrigerator.\"   You know that #first# knows the word \"milk\" but will be curious about the word \"refrigerator.\"  ','If you are fairly sure that one of the words in the note is unknown to #first# then ask #him/her# where the object is.  It would not be very informative if you just asked, as in the above example, \"Where is the milk?\"  #first# knows that already, most likely.  Rather, be sure that you ask #first# a question 1) that #he/she# can answer by pointing and 2) that uses the new word, i.e. \"Where is the refrigerator.\"','If this question is too difficult let this opportunity pass.  At some other time you can ask #first# about new words in written sentences that have even more context that an isolated note.  For example, choose a word in a favorite picture story book.  Spend a few moments finding out what words are unfamiliar to #him/her#.  Then say, \"I\'ll bet you can make a pretty good guess about this word.  \"It says \'and he threw his javelin through the air.\'  Do you see anything here that could be a javelin?\"  If the javelin appears in many sentences #first# will probably be able to point to the javelin in the pictures even if you have never pointed to it for #him/her#.  ','As #first# gains more competence with language #he/she# will be able to give you verbal answers to such questions as \"What do you think a javelin is.\"  But do not rush these questions.  The skill at reading context itself is a high level skill, even when #first# gives you #his/her# answer by pointing.  The skill at putting that thinking into #his/her# own words is an additional skill.','You are giving #first# an opportunity to use #his/her# reasoning to develop #his/her# vocabulary, rather than simply using #his/her# memory for an exact definition of what a new word means.  In fact, you are bringing into #first#\'s consciousness a process of thinking that #he/she# uses already in a natural way.  But when you help to make this type of thinking more conscious, you are helping #first# gain more control over #his/her# own improvement.  ','That billy goat pushed you','Providing a context for learning new words','New words are best learned when they are embedded in both a physical and linguistic context that can be used to figure out the meaning of the new word.  Pointing to an object and saying its name several times is not equally effective.  The next time you introduce a new word to #first#, think about the potential of the context to help #first#\'s construct the meaning of that word.','Lets say that you and #first# are at the petting zoo.  Here there will be many new experiences and many opportunities to help first increase #his/her# vocabulary.  Avoid the usual game of naming the animals on first sight.  Wait for something exciting or interesting to happen.  Lets say that #first# gives the billy goat some corn to eat and the goat sort of nudges #his/her# chest.  Now is the time to say, \"that billy goat must want some more corn.\"  The new words, \"billy goat,\" are embedded in the whole complex of actions and emotions.  #first# most likely will remember the name of this animal better than had you just called out its name when #first# was passively standing in front of the animal.','#first# may talk about the billy goat on the way home.  But if #he/she# doesn\'t you can remind #him/her# of the event that involved the billy goat.  \"That was a fun day.  Remember when that, .... that animal sort of pushed you when you gave it corn.

INSERT INTO `milestones` VALUES (2667,'l_24_2','From Imitating Rules to Understanding Them',' At around this time, children begin to demonstrate certain growth errors in their grammar that may startle parents!  Earlier the child may have said \"mice,\" \"feet, \"Doggie gone,\" \"Doggie went away,\" or \"You came my house.\"  As children\'s emerging sense of language rules develops, they are likely to say instead \"mouses,\" foots,\" \"Doggie goed,\" \"You comed to my house,\" or \"I holded it.\"  Research shows that while children were able to use irregular plurals and past tenses earlier, around this time, children try to make irregular nouns and verbs regular (Dale, 1976)  This is actually a sign of growth.  The child is learning to understand and apply the rules of grammar rather than merely imitate them.  \n\nAccording to Dan Slobin, children learn grammar rules in four phases (Slobin, 1982).  At the first phase, they can\'t yet say the words.  At the second phase, they say the words (such as broke or came) in ways that are grammatically correct, not because they understand the grammar but because they have memorized the words.  At the third phase, children are learning the grammatical rule and tend to overapply it.  The child is actively applying a rule instead of imitating a phrase (Berko, 1958).  At this point, children show an overregularization of the rules.  This means that they apply them in cases where the English language is irregular and they shouldn\'t be applied.  At the fourth phase, which isn\'t until children reach school age (Cazden, 1968), children consistently apply the rule when it is appropriate to do so but not when it isn\'t.  Not only have they learned the rule, but also the exceptions to the rule.  Children may show confusions with more complex forms of irregular verbs and it is not so uncommon to hear a school-age child say \"I swimmed across the pool\" or \"I brang my towel.\"\n\nAccording to Roger Brown, children also go through stages in learning specific grammatical rules.  First, children learn the rules of grammatical morphemes having to do with plurals and -ing endings.  Some related growth errors include foots instead of feet (after learning plurals such as \"foxes,\" children may attempt to create plurals such as footses), mouses instead of mice, and deers instead of deer.  Next, children learn the rules of adding -ed and suffixes to form the third person singular (\"Doggie eats\" instead of \"Doggie eat.\")  Growth errors include \"goed\" instead of went and \"runned\" instead of ran.  Later, children learn contractions of the verb \"to be\" (for instance, it\'s and \"we\'re.\") (Brown, 1973; de Villiers, & de Villiers, 1978).  It appears that children develop rules around the most grammatically simple constructions first and then around those rules that create the most semantically simple construction (Brown, 1963).  \n\nSome research suggests that children do discern a fair amount of information from the grammatical constructions that they hear.  For instance, as early as 18 months, children are able to distinguish information about meaning from the subtle changes in rules, for instance, whether a word is a proper noun or a common noun (Katz, Baker, Macnamara, 1974).  Children\'s understanding of rules also helps them to determine whether a new word connotes an action, a proper noun, or common noun.(Brown, 1957; Nelson, 1977; Nelson, Carskadden, & Bonvillian, 1973).  \n\nResearch shows that parents do a lot to facilitate their child\'s understanding of when certain grammar rules apply (Hovell, Schumaker, & Sherman, 1978; Slobin, 1968).  This includes expanding upon children\'s sentences, recasting them in grammatically correct or more complex forms, and prompting children\'s responses by asking questions in different ways (child says, \"We goed in boat\" and parent responds, \"Yes, we went in a boat\" or child says, \"kitty run\" and parent responds \"The kitty ran away, didn\'t it?)  Certain kinds of parent responses are more effective than others.  Research shows that a combination of expansion and recasting into a modified grammatical form tends to be more effective that merely expanding (Maratsos, 1983).  Children whose parents combined expansion and recasting demonstrated more complex grammatical speech in their spontaneous speech (Nelson, Carskadden, & Bonvillian, 1973).\n','I\'m not feared of you','From imitating rules to understanding them','Shawn and Melissa are taking a nap at their daycare school, but they are not that sleepy.  Shawn takes the blanket, puts it over his head, and says to Melissa, \"I\'m ghoooooost.\"  Melissa has a sober face but is not strattled by Shawn rather tepid ghost. Shawn tries again, \"Look, I\'m a ghooooost.\"  Melissa finally responds.   \"I\'m not feared of you,\" she says and rolls over on her cot. ','You can see in this episode a solicitation by Shawn for a reaction from Melissa.  As is often the case, the child who is solicited often mutes the reaction just as a way to maintain parity between the two children, given that Shawn has tried to exact a brief role of dominance.  But aside from this social dynamic, we hear Melissa use the word \"feared\" when she either meant \"I am not afraid of you\" or \"I have no fear.\"  But her sentence does make sense, even though it is not conventional.  Melissa has made the noun \"fear\" into a verb \"feared\" and it does sort of work.  It is to her credit that her speech is so thoughtful.  Correctness will follow reason, in time.','#first# is likely to utter a sentence with a rule-based error most anytime.  Remember, these types of errors are a mark that #first# is thinking very deeply about language.  Listen for these types of mistakes and respond with support first and gentle correction later.  \n\n· #first# may add \"ed\" to an irregular verb, e.g. comed, goed, and runned\n· Sometimes #first# may add an \"s\" incorrectly to an irregular plural, such as deers, foots, and mouses.\n· #first# may take a noun and use it like a verb, e.g. \"He got goated (meaning he was butted by the goat).\"\n· #first# may get the object of action switched with the agent of action, e.g. \"Owww, scratch the cat (meaning the cat scratched me).','Teachable moments will occur when #first# misuses a grammatical rule, such as using the -ed suffix on the wrong word, like \"goed\" or \"throwed.\"  Your best tactic is to use direct correction sparingly, such as, \"You mean went, not goed.\"  It is better to affirm the content of #first#\'s message first and in the process of summarizing what #first# has said, you can use the correct form of the word.  For example, #first# may say \"The horse goed all the way home.\"  You say, \"I know, that was amazing the the horse went all the way home.\"  In this manner you support #first#\'s disposition to engage in conversations of some length, while at the same time let him hear the correct word form.  And equally important, you are letting #first# hear the correct word form in a meaningful context of the story about the returning horse.  ','He Hitted the Ball','Learning to apply rules of grammar','#first# has just uttered a sentence that contains an overgeneralization of the \"ed\" suffix for the past tense.  It is a pretty relaxed time and #first# and you have been enjoying each other company.  In your judgment #first# would be comfortable at this moment with a game that requires #him/her# to reflect on #his/her# choice of words.  Lets say that #first# has just said, \"He hitted the ball.\"  ','Try to find some way to get #first# to think about this event some more.  \nYou could say, \"With the bat.\"  #first# says, \"Yeah.\"  You say, \"He did what with the bat.\"  #first# replies, \"He hitted it I said.\"   You say, \"Oh, he hit it with the bat.\"   Your objective here is to have #first# utter the incorrect word twice so that when you recast his sentence in the correct form #he/she# is more likely to be focused on #his/her# own words.  Do not embellish #his/her# sentence too much, such as \"Oh, he hit it with the bat real hard.\"  The embellishment will detract from the action event \"to hit.\"\n','The simpliest response would be to run this course.  #first# says, \"He hitted the ball,\" and you say, \"Oh, he hit the ball.\"  #first# might pick up on the difference between your word \"hit\" and his word \"hitted\" somewhat incidentally.  This response is quite natural and fluid, without interrupting the flow of the conversation.  However, when you think it will work, try to engage #first# in a bit more reflection on #his/her# words as done in the example from the section above.','A more advanced response still would be to introduce the name of the rule, not just the correct form of the word.  You could say, \"If you mean he has already hit the ball, you need to say \"hit\" rather than \"hitted.\"  This type of meta-linguistic (language that describes language) is indeed an advanced form of talking, but will come in time as #first# gets older.','The benefits here are rather straight forward.  You are simply helping #first# to use grammar more correctly.  But on another note, by slowing #first# down to reflect on #his/her# words, or maybe even language as a set of rules (meta-linguistic reflection), #first# is acquiring a style of thinking that will be helpful in many areas of learning, not just learning language.\n','The Yesterday Box','Providing opportunities to use the past tense','Find a sturdy box that you can put items in that will remind #first# of something #he/she# did yesterday or even several days ago.  For example, if you went to the park it may be a pine cone from a tree where you played.  You can place pictures from a few days back.  Call this box The Yesterday Box. \nPlace items in this box that had some special role in an activity in the recent past. \n','Pull an item from the Yesterday Box.  Ask #first# to tell you if #he/she# remembers the item.  Say it is the pine cone.  \"Pine cone,\" #first# says.  Then see if #first# can tell you why this object was special enough to be placed in the Yesterday Box.  \"It hitted me.\"    You had decided to put the pine cone in because it fell from the tree and hit #first# on the shoulder and sort of frightened #first# at first.  Ask #first# to say that one more time.  By saying the same sentence one more time #first# will more likely think about the words as well as the remembered event.  Then you can say, \"It hit me.\"  If you say, \"No, say it hit you,\" #first# will probably just reply \"Yeah.\"  ','What if #first# says, \"It hitted meee (i.e. not you)\" when you say \"It hit me.\"  It is up to you to find some way to let #first# know that you are talking about talking, not talking about the event.  Each time you are talking about talking, adopt some standard gesture like putting your fingers to the bottom of your lower lip.  You can try, \"Please say, it hit me, not it hitted me,\" but this may be too teachy for a young child.  Remember, though, there is no need to pressure #first# to say these corrected words on any one day.  It will come in time.  But you can help #first# develop a disposition to monitor #his/her# own speech by using a simple hand gesture when you are talking about talking.','#first# will learn the irregular forms of plurals and then past tense and then even venture into the auxilary verbs such as has, had, and have.  It is appropriate to give feedback from time to time when #first# makes a mistake.  But remember, these mistakes are themselves a sign that #first# is actually using a rule for a class of words rather than a raw memory for a particular sentence.    Find a balance between being supportive of #his/her# new competence (rule application) and corrective of #his/her# over-extensions of a rule.','The objective of these encounters should be to help #first# adopt an attitude of self reflection on #his/her# speech.  The particular success of any one encounter in getting #first# to say the sentence correctly is not so important. When you give #first# your gesture that you are talking about talking, look for evidence that #first# understands this frame outside the frame.  #he/she# might repeat the sentence more slowly or use some other modificaton in #his/her# speech pattern that indicates #he/she# is not just trying to talk about the event, but rather #he/she# too is thinking about his talking.  Using the Yesterday Box itself my facilitate this reflective attitude toward speech, given that that is how you will use the Yesterday Box on more than one occasion.

This reflects their growing sophistication in language and their understanding that things have names that people agree upon and so it is funny to play with them.  This also reflects their growing understanding of how the world works.  (Around this time, they also laugh at mistakes showing that they understand that things are supposed to work in certain ways, and at potty humor reflecting an understanding of rules and testing around those rules (Dunn, 1988).  While younger children laugh at funny sounds or funny sounding words (phonology), such as \"pumpernickel,\" \"pickle,\" or \"pumpkin,\" by 24 months, children are more focused on the meaning of the word (semantics).  They may still laugh when you call them a \"pumpkinhead\" but now they are laughing at more than the sound, they indicate that they recognize it as misnaming (playing with semantics) by laughing and denying that they are a pumpkinhead.  Researchers suggest that this also reveals children\'s developing understanding of negation (Garvey, 1984). (See related Learning Window, Language 30-32 Months.)  Over the next year or so, children will begin to play with words by intentionally misnaming things themselves.  Researcher Roy Pea gives some examples of his own children intentionally misnaming objects for amusement at around 32 months of age (Pea, 1980)  Children\'s ability to misname objects for amusement also reflects an emergent understanding of pretend as children know that what they are saying isn\'t actually so (Garvey, 1984).  Children continue to play with language as they get older and may make up fantasy and nonsense words and between the ages of about three and a half to four years old, may begin to engage in spontaneous rhyming (Garvey, 1990).  (See related Learning Window, Language 42-47 Months.)\n\n','Tuto Laughs at Grover','Getting the Joke about Wrong Names','Tuto is watching Semane Street one morning.  Grover and Gordon are talking about clocks, something about which Grover knows little.  Grover looks at a large grandfather clock and says, \"Oh, I remember this one, it\'s a Grandmother clock.\"  Tuto lets out an explosive laugh and eagerly awaits for more jokes from Grover.  Tuto knows the word because there is a big grandfather clock in his own living room that strikes the time every 15 minutes.  Later Grover sees a wrist watch and calls it a \"finger watch\"   Tuto laughs a little but not so strongly as before.  ','Tuto understands the word game that is being played on the television. He knows, in general, that Grover is misnaming objects.  In some cases Tuto knows that the name is more than wrong.  It is opposite to the correct name or in the same class but the wrong value (e.g. grandmother instead of grandfather).  It other cases he just knows that the \"wrong word\" game is being played, but does not really get the play on wrong value of the same class.  For example, he did not really laugh loudly when Grover called the \"wrist watch\" a \"finger watch,\" probably because he did not know the correct name for the object in the first place.','At this age #first# will probably laugh at misnaming even though #he/she# does not yet invent these games #himself/herself#.

Occassionally ask #first# to hand you something, but give it\'s name a funny twist. For example, if you want the cup, ask for the bucket.  If you want the spoon ask for the shovel. Avoid examples such as calling the cup a glass or the spoon a fork since these word substitutions are not really funny; they are merely wrong.  That is, the bucket is an exaggerated cup and the shovel is an exaggerated spoon, so these variations are funny.  See how #first# reacts to your game. If #he/she# does not react, try other variations, such as, if you want a cup, ask for the pup, or if you want the spoon, ask for the loon. These are sound variations and could be funny to #first#.

Think about the type of humor that the renaming creates.  Is it a new word used with the old adjective (party hat to party cup), or is it a play on words (feathers in pillow on head equals feather brain).  While it might be too early for #first# to offer #his/her# own new words, ask #him/her# gingerly if #he/she# could think of a new name for something like a rain hat that you will wear in the shower.  ','By changing the use of an object and offering a new name, #first# will begin to understand that words often make sense.  That is, they are not always as arbitrary as calling a that hairy four-legged animal a dog or that long orange vegetable a carrot.  Some names are variations on more familiar names, such as race car is a variation on car and wheel chair is a variation on chair.

','2012-08-22 12:30:10','2012-08-22 12:30:10'),(2669,'l_27_1','Asking Wh? Questions','\nTowards the end of the toddler period, around 28-30 months old, children begin a new phase in question-asking.  They begin to ask their first \"wh\" questions such as \"Where he going?\" and the infamous \"Why? in the form of \"Why kitty go?\", \"Why mommy mad?\" or \"Why it do that?\" (deVilliers & deVilliers, 1979).   These are different from the yes-no forms of  questions that children asked earlier and show some understanding of the rules for question-asking, though children still make many errors.  In addition to the significance of emerging \"wh\" questions in terms of children\'s developing language skills, these questions reflect children\'s curiosity and attempts to understand the world and provide an important avenue of communication to help build their understanding. \n\nThe research (Brown, Cazden, & Bellugi, 1969) in this area differentiates between two different forms of questions, yes-no questions and wh questions.  A yes-no question is one that has a yes or no answer.  For instance, \"Do you want a cookie?\"  \"Can I do that?\"  \"Wh\" questions are those that start with an interrogative word: what; where; when; why; how; and so forth.  Children\'s question asking tends to begin with the yes-no type questions though they do not necessarily understand all of the rules for constructing them.  In order to form a grammatically correct question from \"I want a cookie,\" the child needs to change the order of the words as well as the verbs to something like \"May I have a cookie?\"  Two year olds don\'t yet know how to create questions that follow all of the necessary rules, so their early questions are often a form of the statement with an intonation at the end, for instance \"I eat cookie?\" or \"I do that?\"  These questions become increasingly complex as children develop and by three, they will be able to construct sentences such as \"Can I eat a cookie?\" or \"Did Daddy go?\"  \n\nThe second form of questions, the \"wh\" questions, are harder to create and while children begin to form them around the end of the toddler period, they often make errors in doing so.  Simple \"wh\" questions can be formed by adding the \"wh\" word to the end of the sentence, for instance, \"Daddy went where?\" or \"She broke what?\"  Inverting the subject and the object is more complex so instead of \"Where is the doggie?\" children are inclined to say \"Where the doggie is?\" (Klima & Bellugi, 1966)  More complex questions involve adding auxiliary verbs and putting the \"wh\" word at the beginning, for instance, \"When did you go?\" or \"What did you break?\"  When children begin asking \"wh\" questions, they still aren\'t able to construct the proper forms and their first \"wh\" questions take the form of putting a \"wh\" word in front of a declarative sentence, so for instance, \"Where Daddy go?\" or \"What she break?\"  Children continue to have difficulty with the grammatical forms of \"wh\" questions until they are around five years old.  You might overhear a 3 and 1/2 year old saying \"What I did on my birthday?\" or \"How she broke the plate?\"  By age 4 and 1/2 children are able to ask \"wh\" questions in the correct grammatical form.  However, they still find the negative forms of these questions to be tricky, for instance, instead of \"Why don\'t you want some?\" or \"Why don\'t you play with me?\" children say, \"Why you don\'t want some?\" or \"Why you don\'t play with me?\"  \n','Emma asks \"Why he work?\"','Wh? Questions, A new phase in question asking','Emma and her family had spent the holidays at her Grandma and Grandpa\'s house and so had her two aunts and uncles.  While Emma had seemed a bit overwhelmed by everyone at first, she had spent the last few days receiving presents,  playing games, and having a great deal of attention paid to her, and had become quite attached to her Uncle Lee (whom she called \"Uncle Lee\") who     played funny noise games with her.  As it came time to leave, and Uncle Lee   \nsaid good-bye to Emma, she began to whine slightly and asked \"Why he go?\"    \n\"Because he has to go home,\" her mother said. \"Why he go home?\" asked Emma.  \"Because he has to work,\" her mother said.  \"Why he work?  I NEED that one.\"  Emma insisted.                                                                \n','Emma has become quite invested in her Uncle Lee and would prefer that he not  leave.  Her \"why\" questions signal an attempt to understand what is happening and why her uncle can\'t just stay and continue to play games with her.   She knows that sometimes Mommy and Daddy have to go to work and now she is learning that Uncle Lee does, too.  While at a younger age, Emma may have just whined and threw a tantrum, she uses her developing question-asking ability to try to figure out what is happening and if there is a way that she can influence it.  Inherent in Emma\'s question is the question, \"Why can\'t Uncle Lee stay and play with me?\"  This is a grammatical form that is too advanced  for Emma right now.  It involves a negative and even at four and a half, children have difficulty with it.     ',NULL,'\"Why\" questions have many reasons when asked by a young child.  You will notice that sometimes a \"why\" question really means, \"Why can\'t I have what I want?\"  The question is not really a request for information.  In these cases, you can respond with a reflection on the deeper meaning.  For example, when #first# asks why a favorite uncle has to leave, you can say,  \"Ahh, you wish he could stay.  Would you like to ask him to come back again soon.\"  On other times children\'s questions might be about how things work in the world. For instance, #first# might ask, \"Why truck go boom?\"  Try to figure out what was the unexpected.  Compare the observed event with what you believe  #first# expected.  Herein will lie the source of #first#\'s question. Once you have an idea about the discrepancy, that is, the difference between the observed and the expected, you will be in a better position to develop #first#\'s question into a brief learning encounter.  \"I wonder.

Notice that in both cases the response describes the barking dog without giving a real answer to your question.  This is o.k. for a beginning dialogue.  Your child is applying the rule of giving you more information when you offer her a question.',' Try to stay with the topic at least one more exchange.  For example, in the above case after your child says, \"He\'s mean\" you could say, \"Oh, you think he is mean because he is barking.  I wonder if he is mean when he is not barking.\"  Do not expect an answer to this question.  Considering #first#\'s age you are only thinking out loud so that your child can hear how you think.  Be sure not to confuse rhetorical questions, \"Why did you make such a mess?!\" with authentic questions, \"Why did the balloon pop?\"','Later your child will begin with a wh-question and you can model a good response.  If you child says, \"Why he go away?\" you can give a real reason \"he has to go to work\" rather than a description of the action, \"He goes away every morning.\"  ','Wh-questions, both modeled by you and responded to by you, will grow in complexity and subtlety as your child becomes aware of their structure and purpose.    It will help your child communicate if, for example, she can distinguish the different purpose of the question, \"What\'s that (response - a name)?\" versus \"What\'s that for (response - a function).  You support will help your child handle a many such subtleties each day.    \n','Find the Implied Assumption','A why question reveals a deeper thought','#first# has just made an observation that indicates #he/she# is puzzled, that something looks out of place or unexpected.  For example, #he/she# might see a child in a wheelchair being helped down a set of stairs.  #first# might say, \"Why he in chair?\"  Why questions are powerful opportunities to draw #first#\'s thinking deeper than the surface.  Why questions general flow from an expectation that has been challenged, such as, \"Children walk down  stairs on their own legs.\"  ','A good tactic here is to address the implied assumption, such as, children usually walk down the stairs on their own.  You could say, \"You would like to know why he is not walking.\"  This may lead #first# to ask another, more focused question, such as \"Is he hurt?\"  At this point you summarize, \"You think he might be hurt and that is why he is in the chair.  The chair can help him rest while he gets better.\"   The actual facts, whether the child is permanently or temporarily disabled, is not the issue.  You are taking this opportunity, without doing this too often, to encourage your child to reflect on #his/her# implied assumption that lead to the \"why\" question in the first case.','In the modified version of this encounter, you could go directly to the summary.  Take a guess about #first#\'s implied assumption.  \"Do you think that he might be hurt?\"  or \"Do you think that he is sick?\"  While this runs the risk of putting ideas in #his/her# head that were not #his/her# own assumptions, this tactic at least acknowledges that a \"why\" question comes from an assumption.  ','You will be able to take a longer pause to discuss the source of a \"why\" question as #first# grows older.   To continue the example above, you could take the conversation to yet one more round before you summarize.  After #first# says \"Is he hurt\" you could say, \"Could be, so why do you think the chair has wheels on it.\"  The tactic here is to help #first# make connections between both thoughts, the thought about the boy is hurt and the boy is in a chair.  ','You are supporting #first# to make connections between an observation and an assumption.  The assumption, for the most part, is implicit.  #first# may not be aware of the usual event that was not witnessed (e.g., children who walk down stairs), but nevertheless this unobserved event provokes the question to the surface.  By going one step behind the question, #first# will develop a greater understanding about the pattern of #his/her# own thinking.','2012-08-22 12:30:10','2012-08-22 12:30:10'),(2670,'l_27_2','Learning to Negotiate Conversations','Throughout toddlerhood, children are growing increasingly sensitive to the pragmatics of language--the social conventions surrounding language.  This means that they are growing to understand how to engage in effective communication and how to be part of a conversation.  This involves the skills of turn-taking.  Since infancy, children have been learning about how to take turns, vocalizing in response to an adult, hearing a response, and vocalizing again (Kaye, 1982).  Early games of peekaboo or face play also engage youngsters in turn-taking.  Some early turn-taking behavior involves parallel rather than interactive conversation.  Children stop to observe the social conventions of turn-taking in speech even if each speaker is engaged in a different topic of conversation.  They may interact in the form of imitating what the other is saying and doing (such as making sounds together) or to draw attention to something one of them is doing (for instance, \"look at mine!\") (Brownell, 1990; Eckerman & Stein, 1990).  \n\nEarly two year olds show that they have learned some important things about turn-taking in verbal conversations. Research shows that most of the time, two year olds address their messages to the listener and do so when the listener is not listening to someone else (Wellman & Lempers, 1977).  Most interactions took place when the child was playing with another child and they were in close proximity.  By the time children are three, there is only a very little bit of overlap in their speech, as little as five percent, showing that they know quite a lot about turn-taking (Garvey, 1984).  While adults tend to leave little time between turns, children\'s responses are not as quick.  They get quicker as they get older (Garvey & Berninger, 1981).  Early twos are able to take turns fairly well when in conversation with just one other person.  They still aren\'t sure how to negotiate a conversation with more than one person, how to enter a conversation when two adults are speaking, or to negotiate conversations with older children.  By the time they are four and a half, children tend to do better negotiating the complexity of conversations with multiple participants (Ervin-Tripp, 1979).\n\n','Jake pokes at Jessie\'s shark  ','Negotiating a conversation','Jake goes up to his friend Jessie who has a photo of a shark silk screened onto the front of his t-shirt.  Jake presses his finger into the t-shirt and says, \"I like that.\"  Jessie looks down at Jake\'s finger and does not say anything.  Jessie pokes again and repeats, \"Fish.\" and pauses as if to wait for a response from Jessie.  Jessie again looks down at Jake\'s finger and straightens out his t-shirt.  Jake stoops down a little to get his face more into Jessie\'s line of gaze.  \"I like the fish!\" he says directly to Jessie.  Luella hears Jessie raised voice and adds, \"Grandpa has boat.\"  To which Jake adds, \"Let\'s go\" and he runs over to the toy shelf where cars, boats, and trains are in a bin.  Luella follows. ','Jake was trying to negotiate a conversation with Jessie.  Jessie had not quite sensed what Jake was doing.  Was Jake poking him in the chest or was Jake pointing to the photo of the shark.  The poke was a bit more noticeable; the shark as the point of reference more inferential.  Jake sensed that Jessie was not \"getting the point\" so he engaged Jessie\'s line of sight in a more exaggerated manner to get Jessie\'s attention.  Luella responded strictly on the basis of an overheard word \"fish\" that triggers her thought about her grandfather\'s boat.  She does not try to figure out the theme of Jake\'s sentence.  In turn, Luella\'s word \"boat\" triggered Jake\'s idea to go play with the toys, some of which were boats.  Luella responded to the clear directive \"Let\'s go\" but there was no evidence that she knew that toy boats were on Jake\'s mind.  Thus we see the halting way that conversations flow among young children.  Jake made his communicative intent more exaggerated for Jessie, who will, in time, respond with words to these gestures.  And in time, the children will move from turn taking regardless of topic to turn taking where the topic is maintained during the conversation flow.','Children learn to negotiate a conversation by taking turns and asking each other to repeat something.  Here are some general types of negotiations you might hear from #first# as #he/she# learns the rules of maintaining a good conversation\n\n· Asks you to repeat a word spoken too softly to hear\n· Asks you to specify which one of several objects you mean\n· Raises #his/her# voice when #he/she# realizes she has not been heard\n· Makes a distinction between not being heard and not being understood\n· Asks you to wait a minute while \"he/she# thinks\n· Gives you an additional detail when you do not follow the topic','As a partner you can be sensitive to the high level thinking that is required for #first# to maintain a conversation flow.  First, #first# needs to understand that an invitation has been extended for #him/her# to take a turn to say something.  Think about how clear your invitation might be.  Is it direct, such as, \"What\'s is that on your shirt?\" or more indirect, such as, \"I\'ll bet you like that picture on your shirt.\"  Be patient with the unrelated replies  in conversation that are normal at this range.  The topic of #first#\'s comment may have little to do with your topic, but rest assured that #first# is practicing the good rules of taking turns in dialog. Make comments now and then about he structure of conversation itself, such as \"Great, you spoke and then I spoke; we took turns.\"  Be aware that the structure of conversation among three children will be somewhat ragged at this age.  Send Parent Parents a report of conversations you have overheard involving #first# and two other children.  We can build a library of these conversations from which we all can learn.  \n','Waiting for the \"Hey\"','Marking an intent to start a conversation','Occasionally think about one rule of conversation that your child has yet to master. Take for example the establishment of an intent to communicate, something that we do all the time by saying, \"Hey\" in front of a sentence such as \"Hey, what\'s this?\"  From time to time, when you child is trying to initiate a conversation with you, withhold your attention.  Wait until he or she responds with an explicit word or two whose purpose is to solicit your entry into a conversation.  ','Take this case where your child, after a period of silence, says, \"Fish is big,\" referring to  how the fish bowl magnifies the appearance of the gold fish inside.  Wait until the second round, which will probable come very quickly.  \"Daddy look, fish big.\"  Respond with, \"Oh, you were talking to me.  Yes, that fish does look big in the bowl.\"  ','Think about other rules of maintaining conversation.  Some are more or less complex.  For example, letting someone know that you are shifting the topic is more complex than getting some one\'s attention in order to begin a conversation.  And asking your child directly (\"Are you talking to me sweety?\") is less demanding than the example above where you wait until your child provides the improved sentence.','Your conversations will get longer and involve more shifts from topic to subtopics.  Look for ways to maintain the continuity a conversation, even if your child\'s comment sounds like a complete shift.  Providing transitions is another rule of the good conversationalist.  If your child shift from talking about the squirrel to talking about clothes, try to find a connection such as, \"I wonder if I could carry a squirrel in my coat pocket?\"','Conversations are between two or more people with different minds.  Therefore the people involved have to negotiate the course of a conversation in order for it to flow smoothly.   As you become more aware of these rules you will be able to help your child focus on them during the actual discourse with others. That is were the best and most meaningful learning will occur.  The initiating a topic, maintaining at topic, changing topics, providing transitions - each has special words that help.  \n','May I have the mike, please','Using a tape recorder to learn the pragmatics of conversation','Tell #first# that you would like to send #his/her# grandmother a letter.  But instead of writing the letter, you would like to talk her a letter on an tape recorder.  Have the microphone ready.  Explain that you would like to just talk the way you usually do, only this time you will speak into the microphone.  ','Begin by saying something to #first# like, \"Tell me what you have on, so Grandmother will know.\"  Then direct the mike toward #first#.  Encourage #first# to say something in the tape recorder.  Lets say #first# says, \"I got on my jammies.\"  Then alternate turns directing the mike toward yourself when speaking and toward #first# when #he/she# is speaking.','If #first# is unfamiliar with the tape recorder, then you speak into it, let #first# speak into it, and then rewind and hear those few seconds of speaking.  Alternate who is speaking several times.  See if #first# begins to pull toward the mike when #he/she# wants to speak or pulls on your hand holding the mike.  If so, then #first# is beginning to understand the important of being close to the mike.   In this activity, the microphone is used primarily as a way to \"mark\" the turn taking routine of a conversation.  The conversation itself is secondary.  ','Watch for any changes in #first# understanding of how to maintain the flow of the conversation into the tape recorder.  You might hear #him/her# say, as you are speaking into the mike, \"Let me now,\" meaning, I want a turn to speak.   This indicates that #first# is taking a more proactive role in guiding the conversation flow.  Or #he/she# might say, \"not that\" when #he/she# means that the topic you have suggested to talk about does not appeal to #him/her#.  Watch for comments made to you while the tape recorder is on pause.  These comments could be particularly related to talking about what to say and how to talk.','The things that #first# says to you about when and what to talk about into the tape recorder are themselves strategies for guiding and maintaining a conversation.  These strategies deal with the pragmatics of language, that is, the use of language in an attempt to communicate with others.  The microphone and tape recorder serve as a way to both motivate and mark the structure of these social exchanges.  The person who holds the microphone is the designated speaker; the other must wait.  The pause button can give you time to think about the topic and a second \"off the record\" channel of talking where you can talk outloud to each other, but not be \"heard\" by grandmother.','2012-08-22 12:30:10','2012-08-22 12:30:10'),(2671,'l_27_3','Patterns of Pronunciation','As children\'s vocabularies increase, parents may begin to notice certain patterns in how children pronounce words.  How the words sound--the phonology of language--is an area that researchers are beginning to study in greater depth.  According to Cecilia Shore, there is a fair amount of individual difference in how children learn the individual sounds or phonemes of language (Shore, 1995).  While some researchers have suggested that phonological differences unfold following from the expression of  biological factors and thus reflect level of development (Gardner, 1985),  more recently researchers have suggested that phonological expression reflects individual differences but do not indicate differences in level of maturation (Shore, 1995). There are also differences on whether children focus on making individual sounds versus on the overall sound pattern of an utterance.  Some children tend to be conservative in their pronunciations of new words whereas others are greater risk-takers (Shore, 1995).  Researchers have detected a fair amount of consistency from age 1 to 3 in the styles children adopt (Vihman & Greenlee, 1987).  Researchers differentiate between phonological errors (simplifying consonant blends, such as saying gampa instead of grandpa or  substituting simpler sounds for harder ones, such as saying \"Binnie\" instead of \"Vinnie\") and prosaic errors (rearranging sounds, such as psst-getti or bas-getti  instead of spaghetti,   deleting sounds, such as \"punkin\" instead of \"pumpkin\"or  producing neighboring sounds in the same way, such as \"sheeshee\" (Bates, Bretherton, & Snyder, 1988) for \"horsie.\")  Are production errors a result of not hearing what was said?  Perhaps in some cases, but in others, it appears that children adopt certain pronunciations in order to be efficient.  Others seems to value clarity over covering a large number of items with a smaller lexicon (Vihman, 1981).  Some researchers have argued that once children learn to segment what they hear into separate words, this enables a rapid expansion of vocabulary (Plunkett, 1993).\n\n','\"Cat-cat frew\"','Patterns of pronunciation','Jean-Paul is thumbing through a picture book about a caterpillar that eats right through the pictures in the page.  The picture of the apple has a whole in it.  Jean-Paul puts his finger in the hole and exclaims, \"go frew. cat-cat go frew.\"  His mother hears him and remarks, \"You mean go through.\"  Jean-Paul answers with a definite tone, \"Yeah, go frew.\"  ','Jean-Paul has found a way to use an easier sound \"fr\" instead of \"th.\"  His production of this sound is a product of several factors, including how he transforms to the sound as he hears it to match the way he can say it.  So, when he mother says \"through\" he agrees with her as if she had said the same thing that he had said, \"frew.\"  Hearing itself is a result of his thinking about how he himself says the word.  Also notice that he says \"cat-cat\" instead of caterpillar.  This is his invention.  It simplifies the four syllable word into one unique sound repeated twice.  Jean-Paul is making contact with his own thoughts by uttering this word.  Later he will develop the skills to pronounce the word \"caterpillar\" in the conventional form so his audience also knows what he means.','Learning to pronounce words takes some time and has a natural progression.  Here are other strategies that #first# might use to speak words in a manner that is more efficient, given #his/her# level of ability.\n\n· Eliminating consonant blends, such as \"gr\" by saying \"gamma\" for grandmother.\n· Using a sound made with the lips instead of with the teeth, such as substituting the \"v\" in \"very\" with \"b,\" thus saying \"bery good.\"\n· Changing the stress pattern of a word to the first syllable instead of in the middle, such as hearing the word \"hu-mid-i-fi-er\" and saying \"Hum -mid-der.\"\n· Deleting sounds that are nuances, such as saying \"der\" instead of \"fi-er\" in the example above, \"hu-mid-i-fi-er.\"','#first# will learn to produce clear speech in #his/her# own good time.  Many things have to be in place before a child\'s speech is mature, from the muscles that produce the sound to #first#\'s sensitivity to the subtle differences in the sounds #he/she# hears.  You will quite naturally find yourself repeating more clearly the words that #first# speaks poorly.  However, on most of those occasions, #first# will probably just take your repetition as an indication that you were listening and not as an indication that #he/she# mispronounced a word.  If you want to emphasis to #first# that you are now correcting #his/her# speech, try this.  In a very stylized manner, place your finger tips just below your lower lip before you speak.  #first# will look at your hand and hopefully at your moving lips as you say, for example, \"This is how you say that word (through), \"thaa rewww, not (shake your head, then stop) frew.\"   Pronounce the word both ways so #first# can hear the difference.   Keep these type of encounters to a minimum however.  A few times a day would be enough.  You basically just want #first# to get in the habit of monitoring #his/her# own utterances.  ','Marks for Sounds','Using a graphic enhancement to aid word articulation','Pronouncing a word so others can understand it requires #first# to listen to #his/her# own voice as #he/she# speaks.  This type of parallel processing is not so easy.  You can help by making marks on a piece of paper as #first# says a word, not printed words necessarily, just marks.  Take the word \"fish,\" which young children often mispronounce as \"fis\".   Use marks as you listen and talk to #first# in the following way.','When #first# says a word that you think she needs to monitor a bit more, make a mark on the paper as she says that word.  So, if the word is \"fish\" and #he/she# says \"fis\" then make a short straight like on the paper.  Then you say the word \"fish\" and make a longer line with a little hump at the beginning.  Then ask #first# to say the word again and explain that you would like #his/her# mark to look more like your mark.  Also explain that you are merely drawing a picture of the sound that #first# makes. ','It may take some prior steps to help #first# understand that the marks represent the sounds.  You can work on this concept by asking #first# to make a noise, such as the buzzing of #his/her# lips or the clacking of #his/her# tongue.  Make up a mark for each of these sounds that have some intuitive appeal, such as a set of spattered marks for the buzzing of the lips.  Gradually move in the direction of making a mark for an actual word.','If this game is appealing to #first# then you can begin to invent more marks that take on the features that you can use over and over in different phonetics patterns.  For example, a word that ends with a soft sound might have a line that trails off low.  A word that ends an air released by the tongue, such a \"tent\" could have an abrupt mark down at the end.  The main objective, however, is to capture both the way #first# says it and the way you say the word, so the two marks can be discriminated.  ','This activity is designed to help #first# hear #his/her# own pronunciations more clearly.  This is done by providing #first# with a graphic that is more distinctive visually than the sounds are distinctive to #his/her# ears.  In other words, the graphic marks make the sounds visible and thereby help #him/her# hear subtle differences in the way #he/she# pronounces words.  This ability to monitor #his/her# own pronunciation will be a plus for future language development.  ','\"Draw de draw, de draw, draw, draw\"','Singing hard words to make them easier to say','You have noticed that #first# has a class of sounds that #he/she# often mispronounces.  Let say that sounds with \"h\" give #him/her# a little trouble, or perhaps sounding the final \"w\" in words like \"draw\" and \"raw\" presents a challenge.  Think about the time and situation where #first# is most likely to use a word with that sound.  For example, say #he/she# is working on paper with markers, drawing some lines and circles  ','The objective is to make a game for making sounds.  When #first# tries to say the difficult word, and perhaps you help stage the occurrence, tell #him/her# that you are going to sing a little song.  Make up a little song that uses at least three words with the difficult sound.  \"Thaw the raw, we need to thaw the raw to draw.\"  The song need make no sense.  You could even sing, \"Draw de draw de draw draw draw.\"  See if #first# will sing along with you.  Tell #him/her# that this is a game of practicing hard sounds, like the word \"draw.\"  No not get too analytic here, that is, do not break the words down into syllables.  Just be playful and sing the little song.\n','If the direct approach does not engage #first# then wait for another opportunity, but when it presents itself, begin by just singing the little sound play to yourself.  In fact, you could try singing the little sound even when #first# has not uttered the difficult word.  Hearing a string of two or three words that contain the difficult sound my sensitive #him/her# to the sound pattern itself.  Move close to #first# with some body language that suggests you would like #him/her# to imitate your noises.','These little sound games can increase in subtlety.  #first# will gradually eliminate the normal pronunciation erros, such as \"th\" and \"l\" sounds, but will still have difficulty with some vowel sounds.  For example, #first# could be saying \"purpare\" instead of \"prepare\" or \"fur\" instead of \"for\" or \"hill\" instead of \"heel.\"  Make up a little diddy that has both words, such as \"I lost my shoe heel on the dirt hill\" or \"The bear\'s fur is for heat, for heat, for heat..\"   Singing, as an activity, orients #first# to sounds and the constrast between the two words can sensitize #him/her# to the vowels.   Remember, do not be  concerned if #first# mispronounces words for a long time.  It is normal.  These games are used only to help #first# develop a general attitude of reflecting on how he makes sounds.','Quite simply, #first# will learn how to pronounce words.  But more generally, #first# will develop a disposition to distance his thoughts from the meaning of words and to monitor their physical sound.  This is not at all easy.  Imagine yourself thinking about the curve of your mouth when you smile to greet a friend.   Usually you just smile as a warm hello to your friend.  But occasionally we do reflect on the physical act, such as when travelling abroad we might be shocked that our smile is too demonstrative to the French or is enigmatic to the Japanese.   Then we think about smile and monitor its shape in different contexts.  Self monitoring is a skill unto itself.  ','2012-08-22 12:30:10','2012-08-22 12:30:10'),(2672,'l_30_1','A Second Dramatic Vocabulary Explosion ','\nAround two and a half, many children undergo a second dramatic vocabulary explosion.  While children\'s generative (ability to produce or use words) and their receptive (ability to understand words) vocabularies continue to grow extensively throughout the second half of toddlerhood and beginning preschool years, there is another period of particularly rapid growth in the number of words that children can use around 30 months of age.  Between 2 and 1/2 and 4 and 1/2, children learn on average 2-4 new words a day (Smith, 1926).  Researchers suggest that processes such as \"fast-mapping\" and \"lexical contrast\" help children learn new words quickly (Barrett, 1978, 1986; Carey, 1978; Clark, 1988, 1990; Heibeck & Markman, 1987; Markman, 1984, 1987).  Children use context to help them make quick and fairly accurate guesses as to what words mean.  This explosion of productive or generative language that corresponds with the growth of other abilities.  For instance, a connection was found between children\'s ability to categorize and increased vocabulary growth (Gopnik & Meltzoff, 1987).  Cecilia Shore found that children\'s ability to form multiple word utterances corresponded to their growing memory, ability to engage in symbolic play, and block-building skills (Shore, 1986).  Children\'s ability to remember sequences of things and events helps them construct sentences.  The rapid growth in children\'s language learning between one and two corresponds to certain physical changes in the cortex of the brain (Lecours, 1975). The brain goes through three  myelogenetic cycles--the second one beginning at birth and continuing until three and a half to four and a half.  Myelin is a coating that forms around the nerve endings to help make the nervous system function accurately and quickly.  By 3 and 1/2, children actually can use approximately 1,222 words as compared to 50 words that most children can use by around 18-20 months (Smith , 1926).  \n','Don\'t look at me!','Emergent Understanding of the Syntax of Negation','Victor is having a bad day.  It started with an accident.  He says to his mother as he leaves his play space to go to the potty, \"You make sure no one touches my road (he refers to the yellow pieces of plastic he used to make a road).  Before he returned his younger sister had accidentally stepped on his road, now in disarray.  He returns to find the mess, kicks at the plastic pieces, and retreats to a corner to deal with his anger.  His mother draws near to him and waits for his invitation, hoping to console him.  He says,  \"Don\'t look at me.\"  His younger sister comes over, more interested in the nearby books than Victor.  He says, \"No, don\'t come in here.\"  His mother asks, \"Would you like me to read you a book.\"  Victor replies in turn, \"I would like you to go away.\"  ','Obviously the emotional tone of this episode is the dominant aspect.  However, for the moment, let\'s focus on Victor\'s use of negation in his language.  We could only take such a detached view after the event, but then that is where Parent Partners can be very helpful.  Victor\'s use of negation includes the following comments, 1. \"no one touches\"  2. \"don\'t look\"  3. \"No, don\'t come.\" and 4. \"I would like you to go away (which is an implied \"no\" to his mother\'s question about reading to Victor).  He is uses contractions fluently (e.g. \"don\'t\" twice).  He is not saying, \"no look at me\" an early form of negation.  And most interesting, in the last example (number 4), he goes beyond direct expression of the negation (\"don\'t read to me\") and jumps directly to an instruction  (\"go away\" ) that carries an implied negation to his mother.   Victor understands that \"go away\" means \"do not read.\"  In this one comments he has given both an indirect negation to his mother and at the same time a direct instruction about what she should do.  ','#first# will show an increasing ability to use negation in language.  Here are some common occurrences that you might see\n\n· Saying \"no\" as a statement of resistance, \"No go to sleep.\"\n· Stating a preference when asked, \"I don\'t like oatmeal.\"\n· Stating a desire in the negative form, \"Don\'t leave.\"\n· Denying #his/her# belief in something, \"No its not.\"\n· Acknowledging the absence of something \"Not here.\"\n· Reminding someone of a rule \"You can\'t do that.\"\n','#first# can use \"no\" and \"not\" in neutral as well as emotional situations.  However, do not miss an opportunity to learn about #first#\'s language development (or development in any other area for that matter) even at times filled with tension.  What #first# says, the grammar #he/she# uses, the world knowledge that #he/she# draws upon often flow at a faster rate during an emotional moment than in a neutral moment.  Attend to #first#\'s emotional needs at that time, but try to remember the language competence (or any other competence) revealed during that episode.  We are not talking about the rationality of #first#\'s reasoning, because that is often dominated by the anger or frustration that will undo logic or reason.  However, be aware that even illogical or irrational comments can demonstrate a new command of vocabulary, syntax, or rhetorical skill, particularly when #first# is trying to argue in behalf of #his/her# own wishes.  Parent Partners operates on the premise that the more you know about the details of #first#\'s competence the better position you will hold to support growth when times are more suitable for instruction. ','Is this the one you want?','Thinking about the B, not A relation','Since we can speak at any time you will not need any particular toys or materials to engage #first# to use the syntax of negation.  But you can be mentally prepared for an opportunity when #first# is in one of #his/her# more analytic or focused moods.  Look for ways to elicit a discussion about whether something is an X or not, for example, \"Is this the hat you want to wear.\"  Try to find a situation where there is another object that could be the \"X\", for example, another hat nearby.','Present the question and wait for an answer.  If #first# says, \"No, that one(points).\"  Expand this response as follows,  \"I see, the hat on the bed is not your favorite, but that hat over on the table is your favorite.\"  Give #first# the hat #he/she# prefers and then go about your business.  You have done a lot in this brief exchange.  You have recast #first#\'s sentence to include the name of the object (hat) negated as a member of the class \"favorite.\"  In fact, you have condensed the phrase \"want to wear\" into the single word \"favorite.\"   You have explicitly stated the location of the hat that is a member of this class, and have explicitly stated the location of the hat that was negated.','If you sense that #first# might not make these several relations, then focus on one of them.  \"I see, you do not want the one on the bed.\"  Or you could reduce the information by saying, \"That hat (point), but not the other hat (point).  In this latter case, #first# is hearing the structure of A not B at a basic level.','Sometimes these relations are more implied than stated.  For example, you might offer #first# a red cap, and #he/she# says, \"I want my blue cap.\"  While he did not directly say, \"I do not want that red cap,\" you know that this is implied.  Go ahead, on some occasions, and make the implied relation explicit by saying, \"You want the blue cap, not the red one.\"  You can do this no and then, just to give #first# the rhythm of the logic.','It is important for #first# to think about the \"is\" and the \"is not\" as a joined relation.  So often one can define a concept or word only if a clear contrast is given.  For example, a porpoise is an aquatic animal but is not a fish.  This basic logic structure, A, but not B,  can find expression and support in the early years in the manner described above. ','The \"no diving\" sign ','Learning negation from warning signs','At an early age children are curious about the signs that they see.  A number of signs indicate \"no (something).  We have all seen the sign for \"no smoking.\"  in a waiting room or \"no diving\" around a swimming pool, or \"no dogs\" in a public garden.   See if #first# has noticed any of these signs the next time you and #he/she# are near one.','Look at the sign and just say to #first#, \"What does that sign say?\"  If first does not know that the red diagonal line means \"no\" then #he/she# might say\nsomething about the picture only, like \"fire\" for the \"no smoking\" sign, or \"boy\" for the \"no diving sign.  As best as you co take your querry one step further.  \"What is the boy doing in the picture?\"   \"Why is there a big red line in front of the boy?\"  \"Why would someone put a sign like that at a swimming pool.\"  And so forth.  \n','If #first# does not show much interest in guessing, then just say, \"the red line means no and the picure means diving. So the sign means no diving.\"  You might add, \"If the sign does not have a red line in front of it, then you don\'t say no.\"   See if the next time you are in front of that sign #first# will remember what it means.  If so, then #he/she# might know something about the next sign with a red diagonal over a picture.  \"Says no.\" is a likely response.  Then you can see if #he/she# can figure out what is not allowed.','It would be interesting for #first# to invent some symbols on #his/her# own.  Perhaps #he/she# wants to have a private place between #his/her# bed and the closet.  You could help #him/her# make a sign that reads \"no people\" by drawing a person in a circle with a red diagonal line across it.  Let #first# tell you how to draw it if #he/she# does not have the technical skills just yet.','This symbol system represents a negation of an action (smoking, diving, admitting dogs).  As simple as this relation appears, it is actually rather high level because first one has to think of the action (e.g. smoking) and then one has to think about not doing the action.  Since \"not doing\" an action has no mental imagery the concept of \"not doing\" is more abstract.  That is, one can imagine smoking by also seeing that in your mind\'s eye or looking at a picture.  But \"not smoking\" is more a comment on smoking, a logic operation, rather than just another imagined event.  There is no clear picture for \"not smoking.\"  Thus encounters that deal with the logic and syntax of negation are in effect helping #first# to think at a level higher than either mental pictures or pictures painted on signs.  And such thinking is an important part of cognitive development.

This doesn\'t mean that they are just learning negative terms or to understand negation.  Children have shown for these understandings in different ways since they were quite young.  Children have been asserting themselves since their first year by exhibiting resistance, gesturing by shaking their head, (Garvey, 1984) and since the middle of the second year by using the word \"no.\"  More recently, they\'ve expressed negation through such statements as \"Mommy not go!\" \"I no eat it,\" as their vocabulary has grown.  According to Researcher Roy Pea, children\'s earliest negatives are expressions of resistance (\"no!\") and self-prohibition (\"no touch hot.\") (Pea, 1980).  These early spoken negatives involve tacking the words \"no\" and \"not\" onto the end of sentences.  Later, children express another form of negation relating to the disappearance of objects or people in statements such as \"milk allgone\" \"no doggie.\"  (These expressions tend to parallel the development of object permanence, the understanding that objects exist even if they are not in one\'s present field of perception (Gopnik & Meltzoff, 1987).  By around two years of age, children learn to deny, contradict, or correct statements that are false.  For instance, a teasing father might say \"You\'re just a silly girl\" and the child says \"no\" to deny the statement.  Or someone might point to the child\'s nose and say, \"Is that your ear?\" and the child negates the statement by saying, \"It is not!\"(Pea, 1980)  Between 20 and 30 months of age, children might respond to the same question by offering a correct, positive formulation of the answer, for instance, \"That\'s my nose!\" Or by suggesting that something else is so, for instance, if asked \"Is the ball in the sandbox?\" the child might respond, \"it\'s over there\"(Garvey, 1984).  Another way that children show an increasing understanding of negation is when they play with misnaming something--a common two year old form of humor.  At around 30 -32 months old, children are learning to correctly form negative grammatical statements such as, \"You can\'t play\" or \"I won\'t go.\"  Roger Brown refers to this time period as the third stage in syntactical development, characterized by 2.5 to 3 words in a sentence and children\'s ability to create variations on simple sentences (Brown, 1973).  Children often use the word \"won\'t,\" \"don\'t,\" and \"can\'t\" before they use the positive forms of will, do and can.  This suggests that they learn the whole construction rather that the positive form + not (deVilliers & deVilliers, 1979).  By the time children are three or four years old, they do seem to relate the positive and the negatives (deVilliers & deVilliers, 1979).  \n','The Taller The Older','Growing Understanding of Relational Terms  ','Anna is a preschool teacher, in her sixties, graying hair, pleasant but experienced face.  She is exactly five feet tall.  Amy, Anna\'s student intern from the university, is 19 years old, tan, and stretches a good 5\' 10\".  We heard the following conversation one Monday morning with Bobby, a preschool child.\nBobby, to Anna.  \"I can see your head.\" he is standing on a chair that puts him eye to eye with Anna.  \nAnna, \"Yes, now you are as tall as me.\"  \nBobby as Amy walks near, \"but not Amy\" meaning he is not as tall as Amy.  Bobby gets off the chair.  Looks at Anna and Amy who are deliberately standing straight, side by side, as an invitation to Bobby to comment about their relative heights.  \nBobby, \"You\'re older.\" as he looks at Amy.  \nAmy, \"Why do you think I am older than Anna.\nBobby,  \"You\'re all grown up!\"  ','Bobby knows something and does not know something.  He knows the words to use to express the size relation between Anna and Amy.  He also knows the relational word \"older.\"  But we can not be sure of what this word means to Bobby.  He has centered his attention on only one marker for age, but has not considered hair color and complexion as additional cues for a person\'s age.  But we should credit Bobby with some knowledge of time rather than assume that he has simply renamed \"taller\" as \"older.\"  Bobby does answer Amy\'s question with the phrase, \"all grown up\" which sounds more like a process than simply the state of being tall.  In fact, we can presume that he thinks Anna will continue to grow taller.','Relational terms help will help #first# communicate more precisely.  You may find opportunities to use these terms in the following situations.\n\n· When #first# wants one of three toys that differ only in relative size.\n· When the two of you are trying to refer to a person in a group\n· While looking at a picture of a busy scene with many objects \n· When you are making something that uses similar parts\n· Any discussion about possession where \"mine\" is contrasted to \"yours\"\n· The witness of any event where something changes, e.g. longer or thicker','Engaging #first# to think about relational can come naturally in the course of the day.  Look around the house and think about what things can be considered larger, older, newer, sharper, bigger than something else.    Occasionally bring into the same room two or three very familiar objects that vary along one or two dimensions, for example, a set of three shirts where one is short, another long, and a third very long.  The actual presence of these three items,  infrequently seen in an array all laid out, will spontaneously yield some discussion of their comparison.   But without staging these encounters you can engage #first# to use relational words by occasionally holding back when #he/she# asks for an object.  Often the answer to your question \"which one\" will provoke #first# to specify a relation, e.g. \"the bigger one.\"   Also look for opportunities where the relations are psychological variables instead of physical variables, e.g. mean and meaner; happy, happier, and happiest.  These opportunities can occur while looking at family photos of outings and holiday festivities.   The most advanced moments will occur when #first# is working on the relation between two relations, such as \"when I throw it hard the ball goes real far.\"    Your response could be \"Oh, the harder you throw, the farther it goes.\"  But relating relations is something that can wait for a while.','Ask for the Larger One','Using Objects to Develop Relational Terms','Your can help your child use relational words by providing some clearly distinguishable objects.  Use objects that your child likes, whether it is dolls or cars.  Have a variety of sizes in a set of four or five.  Begin to handle them yourself near your child.  Occasionally ask your child to hand you one of the objects.','Say there is a large toy car close to the left side of the table.  Your child is seated to your left on the same side of the table.  There is a small car also to the left but not as far to the edge as the large one.  You ask, \"Sweet, could you give me the larger car.\"  Do not look or gesture toward this object.  To comply with your request, your child has to reach over the small car which is actually closer.   If she asks you to point or otherwise indicate the one you want, try to resist and ask in the same way at least one more time.','To simplify the situation,  you can use relational terms as your child plays.  \"You made the larger car go around the smaller car.\"  Remember to add the \"-er.\"  You are trying to support your child thinking about relations (larger than) rather than giving a single object an adjective (the large car) or a name (\"large-car\").','Some relations are more difficult than others.  Shorter versus longer is easier than shorter versus taller.  And when you hear your child use each of the following: \"short.\" \"a little short,\" and \"really little short\" your child is approaching an understanding of a dimension of change (e.g. length).  Find ways to elicit these distinctions between short (or some other term) and a little more or a little less.','Your are helping your child make an important transition for naming object (e.g. There\'s shorty.) to comparing and relating objects (This is the shorter one).  Understand that sometimes what was the short one, when compared to a longer object, can become the tall one, when compared to a shorter object.  Also understand that an object that is shorter in length could be the taller in height.  When your child is dealing with relations, she is dealing with an abstraction, not with a physical feature, such as a wheel or nose.  Learning relations is both difficult and very important for language development and communication. ','The friendliest dog','Relational terms about pictures','Find a storybook picture that is filled with a busy scene.  The Richard Scary books or the magazine Highlights are good sources.  The picture will probably have a number of people doing different things, like a scene of municipal workers delivering mail, repairing the street, putting out a fire, directing traffic.  Such scenes are captivating by their detail and offer many opportunities to talk about relational words.','When #first# shows an interest in the picture set nearby and observe for a moment.  When #first# adjusts to your presence make a single observation about the picture, such as \"my, there is a lot going on in this picture.\"  This may open #first# to say something to you about the picture.  Take whatever #first# says and see if you can create a relation from it.  For example, what if #first# says, \"Yeah, busy.  Cars all over.\"   You could say, \"Right, big cars and little cars.  I wonder where the biggest car is?\"','If you find it difficult to respond to things that #first# says, venture forth with a question of your own.  \"I see several dogs in this picture.  Some look friendly, some don\'t.  Do you see a dog that is friendlier looking that this one (point to a fairly neutral looking dog).  Be sensitive to how hard it may be for #first# to even find the items you have selected, to say nothing of the difficulty for ranking them on the dimension that you specify.','As #first#\'s language develops further, #he/she# will be able to relation, not only objects to each other, but will be able to relate relations.  For example, #first# might say as #he/she# rolls out a ball of play dough, \"When I make it flat it gets long.\"  Be prepared to consolidate this thought with the use of relational terms, i.e. \"Yes, the flatter you make it the longer it gets.\"','By putting physical relations into language #first# will be in a better position to deal with the logic of these relations, that is, #he/she# will be better able to relate one variable to another, as in the play dough example above.  While language is not the only competence that is required to understand functional relations (the effect of one variable on another), language is a necessary mediator for this competence.   Often it is difficult to know if you are having a language encounter or a logic encounter with #first#.  In fact, it really does not matter.  Have fun and rest secure that your are fostering #first#\'s development by thinking and playing together in these ways.  ','2012-08-22 12:30:10','2012-08-22 12:30:10'),(2674,'l_30_3','Growing Understanding of Relational Terms','According to Peter and Jill de Villiers (1979), children come to understand some spatial relational terms when they are quite young.  For instance, by three years old, children tend to have a fairly good working understanding of opposites such as big and little and can apply these concepts in relation to familiar objects.  When objects are unfamiliar and the child has less background knowledge to reason from, he or she may fall back on rules to help in deciding, for instance: \"Is it bigger than me?\"  \"Could I pick it up?\" in deciding if something is big.  Tall/short is the next pair that children tend to learn, followed by long/short (Clark & Clark, 1977).  Words such as wide/narrow and deep/shallow continue to be a challenge, even for five and six year olds.  Some words appear to invite particular confusions.  For example, research shows that the relational pair, older/ younger tended to be confused with taller/shorter and that children did not seem to observe the contrast between them (Kuczaj & Lederberg, 1977).  The de Villiers point out that the words children learn first also tend to occur with greater frequency in our language (1979).  Spatial terms may come most easily because they have fixed referents.  According to Susan Carey (1978), children first learn that the words are opposites of one another and then begins to associate each term with a dimension.  Between the ages of two and three, children grow to understand the relationship between mine and yours.  In this case, while the terms vary in relation to one another, in generating language from the child\'s perspective, the one that is \"mine\" stays the same while \"yours\" depends upon context.  However, when adults say \"Is that yours?\" the child needs to respond with the opposite (\"it\'s mine\").  Two year olds still demonstrate some confusion around yours and mine (and autistic children persist in this confusion) (deVilliers & deVilliers, 1979).  Other relational terms such as here or there, this or that, now or later are more difficult to grasp because they depend upon the context for their meaning.  These terms take children longer to master and children grow to understand them over the next few years.  Research shows that if there is a clear reference point to divide which is here and there or this and that, children as young as three are fairly successful in interpreting the terms.  If not, such terms continue to create difficulty for five and six year olds (Clark, 1978).   Research shows that there is a fair amount of variation in when children master particular relational terms and that the context of development does not always provide children with clear models of the terms (Garvey, 1984).  For instance, Martha Robb and Catherine Lord (1981) give the example of a mother who called her son \"mother\'s big little helper\" introducing ambiguity as to the polar relationship of the terms.\n','\"Baster and the water comes out the hole.\"','Second Vocabulary Explosion as Memory and Ability to Categorize Grow                                                         ','Harriet likes to spurt water with the basting bulb from in her grandmother\'s kitchen.  She opens the kitchen drawer and pulls out the basting bulb.  \"That\'s a big one.  This a big one,\" Harriet exclaims to her grandmother.  Grandmother asks, \"What do you call that.\"  Harriet gives an inaudible reply, then says clearly, \"and the water comes out the hole here\" as she touches the hole.  Grandmother, \"That\'s a baster.\"  Harriet, \"Baster, and the water comes out the hole.\"','Harriet was familiar with the baster; knew how to use it and knew the name of things associated with it (water, hole), but she did not know the name of the whole object.  When Grandmother supplied the name, Harriet said the word readily and will probably remember it.  She will remember it as part of the context of this object, i.e., the water, the hole, and the action of squirting that she already knows.  Additionally, notice how she shifts, in her first sentence, from \"that\'s a big one\" to \"this a big one.\"  She seems to understand that the word \"this\" is more appropriate than \"that\" for objects that are close at hand.  Furthermore, while she is willing to accept Grandmother\'s name for the object, she also feels compelled to link the new word to what she already knows by repeating its function: \"Baster, and the water comes out the hole.','This second spurt in learning new words will happen as a result of #first#\'s development of related cognitive competencies such as improved memory for sequence and context and improved ability to make inferences about how things are related.  Here are some ways that #first# will pick up new words.\n\n· Hearing a new word in the context of a four to five word sentence, such as \"The steamer on the stove makes the water hot.\"\n· Figuring that a new word is opposite to a familiar word, such as by hearing the sentence \"I get sad when your moody instead of happy.\"\n· #first# use #his/her# ability to categorize to figure the meaning of new words, such as hearing \"The minnow was eaten by a bigger fish.\"\n· #first# will learn new words in the context of symbolic play when #he/she# is more likely to take risks with words.  \n','Once #first# hits #his/her# growth spurt in vocabulary, you can find situations that cause #he/her# to dip into #his/her# pool of new words.  Symbolic play and construction play are two such situations.  In symbolic play #first# will invent scenarios that call on new words that refer to things that are not objects, such as new verbs and adverbs: \"pump the gas\" or \"make it go super fast.\"  With construction materials like Lego or Lasy blocks, #his/her# new words that deal with spatial relations will be used, such as \"on top\" and \"Inside.\"  You can be sensitive to the special value of different types of materials to generate particular classes of words.  In these situations you can offer a few of these words yourself as a way to catalyze #first# use of new words.  You might say during block play, \"I think I will put the long block BETWEEN these two tall ones.\"  The block structure itself helps #first# understand the new word.','Bedside Chat','Recap the day in words at bedtime','Once your child is under the covers this is a good time to engage in little bedside chat.  In the evening you could establish the routine of making some review of the day.  It is helpful for children to put their past experiences into words.','Begin with a simple statement such as: \"Remember the big dog that we saw today, the one at Grandma\'s house\"  Allow your child time to develop a mental picture of this event.  Chose an event that you know made an impression on your child.  See if your child will take this statement as an invitation to respond.  She may say,  \"Big dog.\"   This does not mean she has a mental picture of the past event.  It could mean she is just repeating your words.  ','Invite your child to tell you something about this event in her own words, something that you have not suggested.  You may say, \"Remember what happened next?\" (...the dog had chased their car when they left Grandma\'s) or \"What made you so excited.\"  ','These little invitations should be pleasant and offered as an interest you have in revisiting significant moments with your child.  As this routine gets established you can begin to use some standard word phrases to cue your readiness to listen, \"Remember today when....\" Furthermore, as your child\'s language skills develop, you can give a more open-ended invitation, such as \"Tell me one thing that you remember about today.\"','  Putting recent experiences into words makes it easier for your child to remember those experiences, which in turn makes it easier for your child to compare and contrast experiences and find meaning in those experiences.  ','\"Watch your pram.\"','Figuring out word meaning from context','New words are not just remembered, they are also \"re-constructed\" for pieces of a remembered event.  That is, #first# will remember some of the context of when #he/she# first heard a word and re-construct the meaning of that word by putting those remembered pieces into a sequence that makes sense or in a category that makes sense.  For example, #first# might remember the meaning of the word \"pram\" because she remembers push a toy in a baby carriage in the park where an English woman said, \"Don\'t push your pram over the sidewalk!\"  #first# figured that the woman was not talking about the toy inside the carriage because the English woman was more concerned about what #first# was steering than the object inside the carriage.  So, #first# learned a new word.  At these moments you can help to consolidate the learning.','\"Did she mean your doll?\" you might say shortly after you realize that #first# has heard a new word.  Think about the second most likely object that the new word could refer and identify that object out loud.  By identifying the second most likely object you will accomplish several objectives.  One, you yourself will discover that learning new words does require some high level thinking to eliminate the other possible meanings.  Two, even if #first# was not thinking about this second most likely object, you have alerted #him/her# to its possibility and in turn, to the fact that figuring out the meaning of words is a case of careful thinking, not a case of straining to remember or always asking an adult.','#first#\'s encounter with new words needs to find a balance between high level thinking and direct help from you.  Be sensitive to when #first# needs to have this word directly defined.  \"She was talking about your carriage.  The English call it a pram.\"  You have at least given #he/she# a motive to search her mind for a word that she already knows.  By saying, in effect, a pram is a carriage, you have offer #first# a basic scheme and useful techniques for making meaning of new words, mentally search for some other word that could fit the same context, a word that you already know.','You will be amazed at how many words that #first# is learning.  Resist the temptation to assume this learning has resulted exclusively from some huge leap in her memory capacity.  Think about #his/her# high level reasoning and figure out ways to have #first# reflect upon this thinking.  You could say, \"what does pram mean?\"  Now you are talking about words and not about the real objects.  You are helping #first# put some mental distance between thinking about objects and thinking about words.  Try to time such questions at points where #first# has sufficient verbal and physical context to answer you request for a definition.','An occasional shift from the immediate, physical world to the world of words and meaning will help #first# acquire an even larger vocabulary.   Asking #first# to pause and offer a definition of a word identifies to #first# that there is such a thing as a definition in the first place.  Without these forms of meta-communication, #first# might think that words \"\' in a manner analogous to how objects have parts.  For example, a dog has a name which holds the same relation to the dog as does its ear or tail.

They will attempt to fix communication breakdowns by responding to adults\' requests for clarification in order to be understood (Anselmi, Tomasello, & Acunzo, 1986).  Two year olds are better able to provide clarification in response to requests than in response to statements of fact (Shatz & O\'Reilly, 1990).  Research also shows that most of the time, two year olds address their messages to the listener and do so when the listener is not listening to someone else.  Most of the time, they made reference to things that are close to the listener.  When children didn\'t receive an adequate response, nearly half the time, they repeated their message.  They hardly ever did so when they received an adequate response (Wellman & Lempers, 1990).  This was so for their interactions with children as well as with adults.  Behaviors such as these have led those who study child development to question whether young children are really as egocentric or self-centered as was earlier believed.  Research shows that parents commonly engage young children in questions of clarification to help in the process of communication (\"You want what?\" \"Can you say it to me again more slowly?\")   When children are between 22 and 36 months, parents tend to issue such questions as often as 1 every three minutes with confirmation requests the most common (Gallagher, 1981).\n\nWhile two year olds often monitor others\' understanding and can provide clarification when it is requested, they are not so capable of asking for clarification if they don\'t understand--something that they improve at over the next few years (Garvey, 1984; Revelle, Wellman, & Karabenick, 1985).','\"What time is it (meaning \"Is it my bedtime?\") ','Learning to Provide Clarification','Sari has been joyfully weaving her way among the adults at her house during a family gathering one evening. It is late and she knows that shortly her mother will tell her that it is time to go to bed, which, of course, she does not wish to do.  She goes up to her cousin and asks, \"What time is it?\"  He dutifully looks at his watch and says, \"It\'s nine twenty.\"  She pauses and asks again, \"What time is it.\"  Her cousin thinks that this is a game and replies, \"It\'s nine twenty one.\"  Sari gets a little miffed and says more strongly, \"Nooo, what tiiiimme is it?\"   Her cousin now realizes that he does not understand her question so he says, \"I don\'t know what you mean.\"   Is it time for bed?\"','Sari had an expectation for a class of answers, something that would allay her fears about bedtime being near.  When her cousin\'s answer did not address her hidden message, she simply repeats her question.  When her cousin misses the message a second time, Sari could only think of negating the form of her cousin\'s answer (\"nooo\"), and repeat her question with some added emphasis on the word time.   She did not recast her question into \"Is it almost bedtime?\"  Even though she was sensitive to the failure of her message, she still assumed that the problem lay with her cousin, i.e. she blames the listener.  She did not consider the possibility that her sentence did not carry her request about bedtime.  But when her cousin confesses his confusion, Sari shifts to the implied message without a problem.','Children at this level know several ways to improve the quality of their message\n\n· When asked directly they will repeat what they said\n· When asked directly they will speak more slowly\n· They will be sure that their listener is not listening to someone else\n· They will be sure that the referent object is near or otherwise noticeable to the listener\n','The skill of negotiating a clear message develops in time.  You can play an active role in helping #first# \"repair\" an ambiguous message.

In these situations your words will have clear referents.  #first# says, \"It won\'t fit.\"  You ask, \"Where\"  He replies, \"On top.\"   These moments, even though brief, are great opportunities to work on message repair.

Lets say that #first# has just returned from a parade where there were big floats, bands, and men on horseback.  #first# begins with a flurry of words, \"A girl spinning a stick in the air, big noise, and horses with feathers.\"','You reply, \"You want to tell me about the parade.\"  It is good to orient #first# to the overall topic.  By calling it a \"parade\" you will help #first# focus and clarify.  #first# continues, \"Parade, they walked and played music.  I saw a big drum.\"  You continue to gently nudge #first# to provide a more related context, \"Someone in the band was playing a big drum.\"  This prompts #first# to continue, \"A big, big drum.  He hit it with a hammer.\"  You continue this conversation by responding to #first#\'s comments in a way that helps #him/her# clarify what #he/she# had experienced.  \"Did the hammer break the drum?\"  And so forth.','You may notice that #first# does not accommodate #his/her# sentences following some clarifying remark by you.  For example, #he/she# may continue in a rather disjointed way to tell you things after you offer the word \"parade\" as the topic.  It could be because the word is too unfamiliar.  Let #first# continue to talk.  Help #first# keep the words flowing.  Instead clarifying the overall topic, try to clear up a phrase here or a word there.  For example, say #first# follows your comment about the parade with \"She dropped the spinning stick.\"  You could say, \"Who dropped the spinning stick.\"  Continue in this manner, affirming your general interest and occasionally asking for clarification.','By conversing with #first# in this manner, alternating between listening with interest and asking for clarification, #first# will begin to internalize what YOU are doing.  That is, #he/she# will not only talk to you, but #he/she# will begin to listen to you in a manner similar to the way you are listening to #him/her#.  Thus you sould eventually hear #first# #himself/herself# ask for clarification.  Once this happens, conversations between the two of you will progress even more smoothly. ','Good communication skills are an important part of our social life.  In order to develop a relation with someone, even a brief encounter, #first# will need to be able to engage that person through language.  And the more #first# knows about how to maintain a topic or how to respond to a request for clarification, the more satisfying the social encounter will be.','2012-08-22 12:30:10','2012-08-22 12:30:10'),(2676,'l_33_2','Creating and Resolving Verbal Conflicts','By around three and four years old, children are beginning to learn can both create and work out conflicts by using words.  As verbal activity increases between the ages of two and four, so does verbal conflict (Garvey, 1984).  Building upon a pattern of assertion and denial, children learn to present their opinions and to demand reasons and evidence from others.  For instance, one child might ask, \"Why you get it?\" The other may respond with a common rule of childhood, the right of prior possession, \"because I had it first.\"  The first child might challenge whether indeed the second child had it first at which point the second child needs to provide evidence \"You saw me playing with it.\"  And so it goes.  Research suggests that preschool children commonly get into verbal disagreements over objects, actions, plans or identities for pretend accounting for 57% of youngsters disagreements.  Only 12% of their disagreements were over facts, opinions, or beliefs (Eisenberg & Garvey, 1981).  Eisenberg and Garvey showed that in disputes that continued beyond initial opposition, children\'s responses tended to fall into 8 major categories: compromise (We can take turns) which yielded successful resolution 77% of the time; compliance based upon a certain condition (I\'ll let you do this if you let me do that) which was successful 53% of the time; countering with an alternative plan (You can play with this instead) which was successful 40% of the time; reasoning (I have to do this because....) which was successful 34% of the time;  requesting an explanation (which then led to a different move, for instance, reasoning); mitigating or aggravating the situation (asking please or intensification) which was successful 13% of the time; insisting (reinforcing the message) which worked 13% of the time; and ignoring the other child.  The researchers note that the most successful moves entail being able to adapt and take into account the other person\'s perspective (Eisenberg & Garvey, 1981).\n','From different colors to both','Creating and resolving verbal conflicts    ','Gerald and Shelanda are working side by side painting a large pasteboard box with water colors.  They have decided that this rather tall box is to be a tree.  \nGerald: \"We have to paint the tree.  Paint the tree brown.\"\nShelanda, \"Different colors\"\nGerald: (voice getting louder) \"No, brown.\" (meaning, no, not other colors)\nShelanda, (also getting louder) \"Different colors, green too\" (shaking her head yes).\nGerald, \"Brown too.\"\nShelanda, \"Green too\"\nGerald, \"Both\"\n','At first it seemed that Gerald wanted to use the color brown exclusively.  But it could be that he thought Shelanda wanted to use green exclusively.  Then Shelanda shifts from saying \"different colors\" to saying \"green too.\"  This shift in language helps Gerald eventually express the compromise of \"both.\"  But Gerald could not think about \"both\" until the two children had gone through several rounds of \"green too, brown too, green too, both\"  It was through the social exchange that Gerald, and no doubt Shelanda, came to understand that \"both\" refers to green and brown rather than green or brown.  In this fashion conflicts are resolved by knowing or inventing the language of compromise.','Attempts to resolve conflicts through words can take many forms.  Here are some common strategies that #first# will develop to settle disputes.\n\n· Compromise - \"You can use it a while, and then me.\"\n· Compliance - \"O.K. I will use something else.\"\n· Alternative - \"You use the paint brush and give me the pen.\"\n· Asking for justification - \"Why do you always get the pen.\"\n· Aggravating - \"You can\'t draw good anyway.\"\n· Insisting - \"Its my turn, NOW.\"\n','Verbal conflicts are common.  Imagine a scene where a girl, Shelanda, wants to paint a tree trunk drawing brown but her friend, Gerald, wants to paint the same drawing green.   At this moments it would be a shame if an adult just stepped in the middle of this discussion and said, \"Why don\'t you use both colors.\"  It is better to be present as a focused listener, albeit an adult presence.   However, if the argument persists without the some compromise, it would be appropriate for an adult to say, \"Gerald wants to use brown and Shelanda wants to use green.  What can we do?\"   Sometimes just a little distancing from their immediate target can help children invent a solution.  Our task as parents is not to resolve these type of conflicts but to support our children\'s efforts to develop their own social skills.','But you weren\'t using it.','Using words to resolve conflicts','In any situation where #first# and a friend are having to share objects to finish a project or to share turns to engage in a favorite activity, the road to verbal conflict has been paved.  Listen carefully to the form of their negotiation and be ready to support the more advanced forms.  Lets say that #first# and a friend are using cookie cutters to make shapes in a batch of play dough they have rolled out.  #first# has the rolling pin next to #his/her# work place but is not actually using it just now.  #first#\'s friend wants to use it and makes a move for the rolling pin without asking #first#\'s permission.  A small size conflict emerges.  You notice that the children simply argue \"I had it first\" on the one hand and \"but you weren\'t using it\" on the other hand.','Try to keep the conflict at the verbal level, rather than allowing them to resort to physical dominance one over the other.  Both children probably know that this encounter is not so momentous that it would demand force.  Try to move the discussion in the direction of a compromise or at least a conditional compliance.  The later might sound something like this, \"Is there anything that ( #first#\'s friend\'s name ) could do that would make it easier for you to give up the rolling pen.\"   Of course, #first# may want to state new reasons why #he/she# can not give up the rolling pen.  If so, see how this sets with #first#\'s friend.  Remember, your role is to help the children reflect on the structure of their negotiation as much as, or more than, to help them actually resolve the problem.','If you see that the conflict is about to take a turn for the physical, set in with a verbal reflection.  \"Looks like things are heating up here.  Let me hear you talk some more about what you should do about the rolling pen.\"   If the day seems lost regarding an opportunity to learn, take a direct approach with something like, \"I will place the rolling pen next to me until you both can think a little more clearly.  For now, just use the cookie cutters\"','You should notice that #first#\'s ability to negotiate will improve.  While #he/she# might begin with insistence (\"I neeeddd that rolling pen\"), #he/she# will become more capable of including some compromise that appeases some of the needs of #his/her# friend (\"You can use it in threeee minutes, o.k.).   #first# my try to give counter suggestions (\"You could use your hand to do it.\") but will eventually, particularly when #he/she# is interested in preserving a friendship, #he/she# will relinquish some of the control (\"O.K., but can you give it back soon).','The stages of negotiating conflict go on and on, even into adulthood.  The proper use of language is a key.  There is a world of difference between \"I got to have this\" and \"I need to use it.\"  The first does not provide a door for negotiated and could cause the partner to come back with a strong reaction.  But over time and with your support #first# will learn the subtle art of solving conflicts through verbal negotiation and protect the warm relations with #his/her# friends as a consequence.','\"Listen to this argument, o.k.\"','Helping #first# read a social encounter','There are occassions when #first# is more a witness to a little squabble than a participant in the conflict.  These occassions also present an opportunity to engage #first# to think about verbal strategies for resolving conflicts.  Imagine that #first# has just seen two characters on television have a disagreement, such as Bert gets angry at Ernie on Sesame street.  ','Make some comment about the episode to indicate you want to talk about it later, such as, \"Listen to this argument, o.k.?\"  Then when the show is over, return to the topic of the squabble between the television characters.  \"What were they fighting about?\" could be an entry.  Eventually follow with, \"What did they do so they could remain friends.\"  In most cases, particularly in a story line, the conflict is resolved.  See if #first# can put these social dynamics into #his/her# own words.','If #first# does not remember the conflict episode, you could recall some of the details.  If you think that this activity is still too difficult, try using a video tape rather than a television show.  With a video tape you can pause the play of the tape and ask right then and there, \"What are they fighting about.\"  Now #first# has an opportunity to make an immediate comment rather than wait until the show is over.','These encounters could lead to asking #first# not only about what did happen, but what might have happened or what might have been a better response.  If you can play these games with a video tape, that is, if you can stage the game as a sort of standard routine with a video tape, you will have a powerful medium for language and cognitive development.  By pausing the tape and asking #first# what is likely to happen you have engaged #first#\'s mind in an active rather than passive manner.  Be alert to the difference between #first# remembering what comes next versus using some idea or principle to predict what is likely to happen or what would be a good thing to happen.','If #first# can read a social situation then #he/she# can learn for #his/her# own mistakes and even from the mistakes of others.  A social encounter contains \"information\" for #first# only to the degree that #first# can discern a social event, e.g. define the boundaries of a conflict,  identify the strategy of conflict resolution.  By helping #first# learn to \"read\" a social encounter you are also helping #first# learn from #his/her# own experience to be more sociable.

Sometimes these are gaps that occur due to forgetting and at other times, the child may not have known a word to fill the gap.    Invented words typically follow some of the conventions of language and rely upon context to be understood (Clark, 1982).  Children\'s inventions tend to follow certain patterns and to abide by the following three principles (Clark, 1981).  Their inventions tend to be productive in that they follow similar forms as adult words.  For instance, to create a verb, a child might add -ing to a noun (\"I\'m crackering my soup\")(Clark, 1981, pg. 304) or to create a noun from a verb, a child might add -er (\"scooper\"-- using the verb for scoop to name a good device for scooping.)  Their inventions tend to make it easy to see the relationship between the thing and the word--they have semantic transparency.  For instance, \"money-stealer\" instead of thief or robber, or \"cutter\"  instead of knife).  Their inventions often regularize language. For instance, \"pianoman\" instead of \"pianist\" or \"deers\" instead of \"deer.\"   Research by Jean Berko and others (1958; Myers Pease, Berko-Gleason, & Alexander Pan, 1989) showed that preschoolers were able to invent words to fit particular meanings (for instance a zib-man as someone who zibs for a living).  They often used techniques such as compound words instead of adult strategies such as adding -er.  Later research confirms this finding.  As young as two and a half, children used compound words to create subcategories of items (apple-knife for a knife for cutting apples) and mouse-hat (for a hat for a mouse) (Clark, Gelman, & Lane, 1985).\n','It\'s a rock put-er','Inventing words that carry meaning','Sam and his older brother Billy were looking at the new games at Toys R Us.  They came across an interesting box with pictures of the characters in the game, dragons, knights, and foot soldiers.  Sam points to a picture of a catapult and says, \"Oh, I know what that is.  It\'s a rock put-er.\"  Billy, as older brothers are prone to do, corrects Sam, \"You mean a cataput (sic).\"','Sam knew the use of the object in the photo, to hurl rocks over the castle wall.  He evidently remembered some of the sound \"catapult.\"  So to fill in the gaps in his memory, he combines three things: the rock that is hurled (thus \"rock\", the function of hurling it, and something that approximates part of the vaguely remember sound (\"put-er\" = function plus the sound \"pult\").  His brother, either confused by his younger sibling, or by doing some of his own invented naming, comes up with \"cataput.\"  This word draws more on his memory for the first syllable of catapult, but he assimilates the last syllable to his brother\'s choice of function plus approximate sound.  Who ever heard of a \"pult\" anyway. ','#first# will often find #himself/herself# in a situation where #he/she# knows something about an object or event, but does not know are remember the exact and usual name.  Here are some other occasions where you might hear #first# invent new words, words that are themselves clever in that they use some of the rules of languages and have an intuitive appeal.\n\n· #first# invents an action word by adding \"-ing\" to a noun, like \"dolling\" for rocking a baby doll to sleep.\n· #first# adds an -er to a verb to make it noun, like \"bender\" for the pliers    #he/she# saw used to bend wire.\n· #first# uses a compound word to name a person or object, like \"fire-stopper\" for forest ranger, or \"dirt-sucker\" for vacuum cleaner. \n· #first# uses two words together to specify a subcategory, such as \"paint pencil\" for a colored pencil, or \"cookie sandwich\" for a small cocktail sandwich.\n','The teachable moment begins when #first# has invented  some clever word that has an intuitive appeal, such as \"paint pencil\" for a colored pencil or \"dirt sucker\" for a vacuum cleaner.  At these moments #first#\'s mind is alert and inventive.  You might be able to extend the moment by looking for other objects that could have an invented name.  For example, if #first# calls the vacuum cleaner the \"dirt sucker\" then ask #him/her# what you call the xxxx (point to something like a broom, a dust buster, or a feather duster).  If #he/she# gives you the ordinary name, you can counter with, \"Yeahhh, but we could call it a xxx (\"dirt mover\" or \"small dirt suck\" or \"spider web getter\").\nIf you can draw #first# into the game, then #he/she# might find other objects, even objects for which #he/she# knows the name, and decide to invent a new name.\n','The Farmer is Gizzing His Cow','Inventing words that can be defined in context','Inventing words is as fun as it is useful.  You can make inventing words a game.  Tell #first# that you are reading something that you do not understand.  \"This paper says that a farmer in Finland was gizzing his cow and the cow knock over the giz bucket.  What on earth does that mean, gizzing his cow?\"  ','Let #first# make a guess.  If #he/she# has any trouble guessing milk, then give #him/her# a few more context clues.  \"Well, it says that the cow knocked over the giz bucket.  I wonder what kind of bucket that would be?\"  At this point, #first# might make a guess.  Once #first# has the hang of it, you can create more examples.  The idea that these words come from another country gives the game a degree of motivation.  But it does not matter if #first# treats the example as a fantasy; it is a game.  ','One way to make the game a little easier is to add pictures.  If you had a picture of the farmer milking the cow you could then write under the picture, \"Here we see a farmer in Finland gizzing his cow.\"  Then you could ask #first# what the word gizzing means.  At first #he/she# might be confused, because #he/she# sees the farmer milking but hears the word \"gizzing.\"  But that\'s the point.  Can #he/she# figure out the \"Finnish\" word by both listening to the sentence context and by \"reading\" the picture context.','The natural progression to more difficult versions of this game is to encourage #first# to invent new words.  You could show #him/her# a photograph, say, of a group of mean from Greek sitting around preening a huge stack of sponges, or something else that looks like work but which #first# is probably not familiar.  You could scaffold the game by beginning, \"Look at all those sponges in this picture, and the men doing something with them.  Why don\'t we make a title for this picture.  \'The men are __________ together.\'  We could make up a word that makes some sense.\"  If you had make the title begin \"The men are ___________ the sponges\" then #first# would just say the word \"cleaning\" or \"cutting.\"  The right picture helps too, such as a group of Sardinian shepherds who are sitting around doing something to a gizmo that is not at all familiar.  These scenes could provoke a creative stance toward the game.','By inventing words #first# is actually making the rules of word formation more conspicuous.   By adding the \"-ing\" suffix to an invented word, the role of \"-ing\" becomes more noticeable.  As in the word \"gizzing\" the \n\"-ing\" part is the only familiar part of the word and it marks the word as an action word.  Inventing is also a way of encouraging #first# to take an educated guess or to use inference and context in addition to memory to understand a new word.  This disposition to use #his/her# higher level thinking will serve #first# well through out #his/her# life.\n','The pecking seat','Using cut up pictures to invent new words','A good way to stage an occassion to invent new words would be to show #first# some mixed up pictures.  A pasted up picture that is half car half goat might draw some interesting labels.  Give it a try by cutting up pictures from a magazine and pasting them into incongruous and comical images.','Show #first# a few of the pictures, more than one so you can frame the time as a game.  Begin with an invitation to figure out what these strang pictures might be called.  If the game needs more motivation, say that you are making pictures for a world beyond the clouds, where animals are part machines and where fruits are part furniture.  But you have to make a list of all of the names of these new things, so they need names.  Give #first# one of your composited pictures, say of a chicken with four chair legs instead of chicken legs.  See if #first# can come up with a sensible name for this nonesensical object, perhaps \"henchair\" or \"pecking seat.\" ','If #first# does not show much interest in your game, then follow up with a few names that you heard \"another child\" offered.  Give a few pictures an invented name.  Then let #first# choose one of the remaining pictures with the understanding that #he/she# will come up with a name.  By giving #first# more choices you have increased the likelihood that #he/she# will be drawn into this game of inventing names.','Suggest that you and #first# make up other members of this world beyond the clouds.  Take several normal pictues from magazines and cut them up with #first#.  Start to put them together into incongurous images, objects that have could be a play on constrasts, such as a basketball on a golf tee, or a flashlight as an eye patch.   See if #first# has any ideas not only about want to name incongurous objects, but if #he/she# can even invent the incongruous object itself.','You have provided #first# with an environment of whimsy and inventiveness.  The invention of new words is actually a play on the rules of making conventional words.  Therefore these inventions put the standard rules into greater relief so they can be seen.  In addition, an inventiveness with words will ultimated by fine tuned to what we call poetry, metaphor, and expressivity in writing.

Their ability to do so hinges in part upon the complexity of the request and how much information can be ascertained from the surrounding context.  For instance, two and 1/2 to three year olds playing together might use simple, nonspecific requests for repetition, clarification, confirmation, and elaboration that make sense in the context of their play.  Catherine Garvey gives an example of two children (32 and 33 months old) who are playing and use the word \"huh?\" to request nonspecific repetition, \"three?\" in a questioning tone for confirmation of amount, and \"where?\" for more information on where something should go (Garvey, 1984).  In this case, the context makes it clear to both children what is being asked.  Children made such queries of both peers and parents.  In instances when it is less easy to discern the message from the context, three and four year olds find asking for clarification more challenging and four year olds are more successful than three year olds.  In part, this depends upon how difficult the task is.  Three year olds showed that when a request was ambiguous (asking for something that could be one of four objects) or impossible (asking for something too large to move--the refrigerator--or something that wasn\'t available--mother\'s slippers) the children did ask for clarification, though four year olds did better than three year olds.  When a ridiculous request, such as in the research, \"Bring me the refrigerator,\" even three year olds recognize that it is problematic and that something is wrong and look to the adult to clarify the statement (Revelle, Wellman, & Karabenick, 1985).  If there is simply information missing, children don\'t consistently notice until about third grade.  This is much more challenging because it requires knowing that something is missing which necessitates knowledge about the task.  \n\nParents can help children to learn how to ask for clarification as they model techniques for doing so to children in the questions they ask children (for instance, adult to child, \"I can\'t tell which one you want.  Can you show me again?\" or \"I can\'t tell what you\'re saying.  Can you say it to me again in other words?\") \n',' \"Gotta get it in\"','Clarifying how to win a game of skill','Vic and Mark are playing a game of skill.  They are trying to hook little plastic fish using a bead on the end of a string.  The fish rotate in a revolving tray and their mouths open and close.  The trick is to drop the line in the fish\'s mouth, wait for it to close, and then gently pull the fish from the revolving tray.\n\nVic:  \"Gotta get it in.\nMark: \"What\"\nVic: \"In the mouth; it closes.\"\nMark: \"It closes?\"\nVic; \"Yeah, that\'s how you catch it.\"\nMark: \"The mouth closes.\"\n','This little conversation has some a rather sophisticated structure.  When Mark asks for clarification (\"What?\") Vic understands that Mark is asking for more information.  That is, Vic assumes that Mark heard what Vic said, but did not understand.  So Vic adds information \"In the mouth; it closes.\"  This time Mark repeats the part he does not understand, instead of just using an indefinite request for clarification (i.e. \"what?\" or \"huh?\").  This helps Vic relate the closing of the mouth to the goal of catching the fish.  Mark confirms that he heard the message by saying \"The mouth closes.\"  In this fashion the two boys communicate by giving more specific requests and information.

At these times #first# can either try #his/her# best to figure out what you mean from the context or #he/she# can pause and ask for clarification.  When #he/she# does ask for clarification help #first# to go beyond a nonspecific request for repetition, such as \"huh?\" or \"what?\".  You can say, \"What did I say that you do not understand?\" or more simply, \"Why did you say \'huh\'?\"  You can also support #first#\'s language development by pointing out the difference between an unspecified request for clarification (e.g. \"What?\") to a specified request for clarification (\"This car?).

','If #first# ignores your request or for a second time gives you just any red brick nearby, it is time to self-reflect on your own language.  You could say, \"Perhaps I was not clear.\"  This comment addresses the quality of the message rather than the intelligence of the listener.

What children laugh at changes with development.  At around 14 months, children are amused by discrepant events, at around 24 months, children tend to be amused by forbidden behavior, potty humor, and mistakes and misnaming, and between 18 and 36 months children begin to play with language and social rules (Dunn, 1988).  Beyond the testing of  rules, children\'s social humor sometimes takes on an element of social word play.  They may make up fantasy and nonsense words and between the ages of about three and a half to four years old, may begin to engage in spontaneous rhyming (Garvey, 1990).  According to Catherine Garvey (1990), this poetic nonsense often involves outrageous names (such as Uncle Poop, Sillyface, Dumbhead) and unlikely events with just enough real world sense to hold them together.  In the context of this rhyming, children may test out how absurd they can be and how far they can push each other.  The delivery of the narrative may sometimes seem serious and it is children\'s up-roarious laughter afterwards that gives it away as social language play.','James and His Friends\' Substitution Word Game','Social Silliness with Language','James is attending the birthday party of a friend.  Five boys sit around a    \ntable waiting for a slice of the birthday cake.   Mark, the birthday boy, asks his mother for some juice.  She holds up a can of Apple Juice that has a picture of an apple with eyes and a smiling mouth.  She asks,  \"Would you like some of this?\"  Mark says, \"Yes, I would like some of that Apple.  James notices the picture, \"You mean Apple Head\"  A second boy joins in, \"Apple La La Head.\"  The third boy adds,  Apple Pu Pu Head.\"  These two boys laugh. Mark is now upset, \"You can\'t call my mother that.\"  Mark\'s mother, \"Oh, they were just talking about the can, Mark.\" \n','James and his friends have discovered the fun of word games that involve      \nsubstituting one word in a phrase, first Apple Head, then La La Head, then Pu Pu Head.  This game is fun precisely because they are each making the phrase  more ridiculous by degrees until the final insult of \"Pu Pu Head\" a taboo word that makes some of the boys laugh.  Mark realizes that \"pu pu\" is a dirty word and reacts to defend the day, probably meaning, \"you shouldn\'t talk that way in front of my mother\" but it comes out \"you can\'t call my mother that.\"  In spite of the unsavory direction of this game, it does represent how children  \ncan pick up on each other rules of word play and make a game that involved four of their group. \n','This play with word silliness is not so silly when you consider the thinking that it requires.

But if the form is not completely silly, you can salvage a teachable moment here and there.  You can offer a follow up version of a silly name or description that is just one level more sophisticated than #first#\'s word.  For example, say #first# thinks it\'s funny when her friend calls a mouse in a cartoon a \"ding bat.\"  You might offer, \"a ding bat, or maybe a ding mouse.\"  You have implied a comparison between a mouse and a bat and offered a silly word that more clearly refers to a mouse.   Teaching by deflecting energy is better than trying to stop that energy, that is, extending #first#\'s silly words into words that have some poetic grace is better than discouraging the game altogether.','One, two, huckle my blue.\"','Words games with counting rhythms.','#first# is jumping rope.

','#first# might just keep jumping #his/her# rope.  That\'s o.k.  Wait for another day.  Another opportunity to play word games will occur.  But #first# might find your mixing of words delightful.

Instead of \"five, six, pick up sticks\" you could say \"five, six, hick up bricks.\"  ','If #first# just laughs but makes no attempts to offer #his/her# own variations, prompt #him/her# a little.  \"I wonder what we could say instead of seven, eight, swing on the gate.\"  Give #first# time to try.  It is possible that #first#\'s substitutions will be based only on similar sounds rather than any particular meaning.  Expect something like, \"seven, eight, swing on the bait.\"  That\'s o.k.  You are supporting #first#\'s inventiveness with words.','If this game has really clicked for #first# then try other counting rhythms or other very familiar jingles, such as those from television that you know #first# has almost memorized.  For example, say you know #first# recognizes the Star Trek tag line, then you change it to \"To boldly glow where no man has glown before.\"  Invite first to make up a new version as well.  Decide on which one you like and maybe even discuss why.  Be alert for comments such as \"no, not that,\' which means #first# is applying some rule of grammar during this play with substituting words.','Play with words helps #first# concentrate on the form and structure of language.  Separating #himself/herself# momentarily from the demands of clear communication and factual memory will allow #first# to reflect on such issues as how an adjective modifies a noun or whether a verb or a noun best completes a thought.  Since not all phrases are equally funny, or not even acceptable, #first# by virtue of these acts of selection, is engaged in higher level thinking about the structure of language.','\"The shovel bug digs his friends.\"','Using weird objects to elicit word humor','A collection of unusual objects can elicit a flurry of unusual words.  In this situation you would like to frame the activity as a play on the humor of words, not just their silliness, but their genuine humor.  Lets say that you have a cigar box that contains a lot of wiggly plastic spiders, bugs, and newts of all shapes and colors, like something you can get in a novelty shop.  Use this collection of weird insects and worms to elicit a game of word humor.','Open the box and expose the weird looking bugs.  Add some props like cups and fragments of cloth that can serve as a terrain and therefore the beginning of a story.  Chose one of the bugs and begin a narration about the bug, what he does most of the day.  Then throw in something that is a play on the humor of words, \"This bug does not sit in a chair.  He\'s go so many eyes that he sits in a stare.\"  Slip in a few more of these word play examples and then invite #first# to join the fun.','If first just wants you do make up the jokes, that\'s fine, at least as an introduction to the word humor game.  But gradually solicit some input from #first# for help, such as \"which bug shall we talk about next.\"  Or \"where should we have this one sleep.\"  By gradually bringing #first# into the decision making you will discover that #he/she# will engage #his/her# mind and will more likely join in the higher level of the game, e.g. making jokes with words.','Look for cases were #first# begins to make jokes #himself/herself#.  Also make a note of the complexity of the joke.  A joke that comments on both the ordinary word and funny word is rather complex, more so than a joke that just offers a funny word.    For example, \"The shovel bug didn\'t hug the beatle, it dug the beatle.\"  Compare that to \"The shovel bug dug the beatle.\"  Note if the joke is even a word substitution game, which is a defining feature for word humor.  It is not a word substition, at least not an obvious one, to say, \"The shovel bug buried the beatle bug.\"  Humor will become more complex later.','Word humor involves an interesting perspective on words as words and the relation between words that sound similar but have different meaning.  For example, the play on \"dug the bugs\" and \"hug the bugs\" is somewhat funny because the \"dug\" could have both a literal meaning, \"to dig a hole\" and a metaphorical meaning, \"to dig, as to like\'\" while at the same time be a variation on the \"_ug\" sound of \"hug.\"  So in these simple games you are in effect encouraging #first# to take a reflective stance toward the crafting of words, which in turn can lead to the higher skills of narrative and poetic writing.','2012-08-22 12:30:10','2012-08-22 12:30:10'),(2680,'l_42_2','Speaking in Different Voices','Around the age of three or four, children begin to show that they understand the concept of \"speaking in different voices\" for different reasons and different audiences (Garvey, 1984).  For instance, at this age, children often can modulate their voices in order to talk the babies and engage in classic \"motherese\" where they heighten the pitch of their voice, use short engaging sentences, use repetitions, and an exaggerated intonation (Garvey, 1977; Shatz & Selman, 1973, 1977; Sachs & Devin, 1976).  Children as young as two do make speech adjustments when talking to younger children, thought there are considerable individual differences in children\'s ability to do so (Dunn & Kendrick, 1979).  One could argue that they are simply imitating their parents, not actually thinking about the voice that they are using.  Researchers investigated this possibility and found that a fairly low incidence of children\'s statements were actual imitations of parents\' statements (Dunn & Kendrick, 1982)  Children demonstrate that they are taking into account the linguistic and cognitive capacities of the younger child and are speaking in voices that reflect their understanding  (Dunn & Kendrick, 1982; Bretherton, McNew, & Beeghly-Smith, 1981).  When pretending to be babies, children showed that they knew some things, though not everything about what baby speech might be like (Sachs & Devin, 1976).  Researchers have surmised that age may be a particularly salient characteristic for children in learning about how to adjust their speech for different audiences (Sachs & Devin, 1976). \n\nWhat about changing ones\' voice to serve other purposes?  As preschoolers, children begin to use different voices for different characters (Rubin & Wolf, 1979).  Children change their voices while pretending to be a mommy, daddy, fireman, doctor, and so forth as part of their pretend play.  In research using puppets, children between the ages of 45 months and 7 years old were able to moderate their voices to suit different roles, using a more formal voice and language for some characters, and different emphases and conversational styles for others (Andersen, 1977).   Children are also learning to moderate their voices in terms of whispering or saying things in funny ways showing that they recognize the communicative context that surrounds what they say (Garvey, 1984).','The Turkey Vulture Dinosaur','Learning New Vocabulary From Storybook Reading   ','Sammy loves books about birds.  He knows the names of many birds.  He has a friend over one afternoon and showed his friend one of his bird books.  He flips through the book and says, \"\'Every bird is in this book!\"  He continues until he gets to one particular picture, \"Oh, here we are!  This is a turkey vulture.  Its a bird.  Its some kind of dinosaur that had its eyes like this.  It eats bones and lives in North Carolina, and here, and much more places.  It also eats meat.\"  ','If Sammy knows this much about turkey vultures we can assume that he knows a lot about other birds too.  He almost has the scheme down for how you list name, class, evolutionary origin, habitat, and eating habits.  It is probable that he learned this format by listening to someone read to him from books.  We don\'t quite know what he means about \"dinosaur that had its eyes like this\" but we can guess that he had learned that the dinosaur eyes had similar shape as the turkey vulture eyes.  And we are not sure if he understands that the turkey vulture is not itself a dinosaur, but rather the net result of a long evolutionary process.','The are other media and symbols that almost cry out for an identifying word, not only pictures in a story book.

Encourage #first# to take an active role in the story, particularly if it is a favorite that you have read before.  Ask #first# to identify objects in the pictures, but be particularly attentive for chances to ask about actions, e.g. \"where do you see someone digging.\"  In these cases see how #first# can handle the question if you do not mention the name of any object, such as \"where do you see some men digging a hole?\"  In this second wording, #first# can just point to the hole or to the men without having to use higher level thinking to figure out the action of digging.  Think about the higher objective of language development, which is learning to use words and figure out meanings from context, as opposed to just building up a vocabulary of isolated words.  With the higher objective in mind you will find ways to use the story line itself to learn words,  For example, you might say while reading the Frog and the Prince \"The handsome prince was transformed into an ugly frog.  What do you think that means \'transformed\'?\"  Storybooks provide many teachable moments if you are in that frame of mind.\n','What shall we call the fork lift?','Figuring out new words by studying pictures in a book\n\n','Get a Richard Scary book or any other book that is rich in pictures of people doing things.  You can begin the activity by listening to what #first# says about all the business in the picture.  At some point #first# will probably stumble on the name of something or invent a substitute name.  This presents both an indication of need and an opportunity for support.  For example, assume that #first# is looking at scenes of the logging industry and does not know what to call the \"fork lift\" that is stacking the recently cut and planned lumber.   You hear #first# say, \"That stacking machine piles up the boards.\"','Your response could be a direct correction, but take a moment to support #first#\'s ability to figure out a more appropriate name.  \"You call this a stacking machine.  Does that mean it is used only to stack things?\"  #first# might choose to say \"Yes\" in order to avoid the game.  That\'s o.k.  Your question was heard nevertheless.  On the other hand, #first# might pick up on your question, think, and say something like, \"Well, it might just move a real heavy something, like a gigantic log, to a truck or something.\"  At which point you can move in with the comment, \"Then why don\'t we call it a lifting machine.\"  It is not important to teach the whole name, \"fork lift,\" at this moment. ','If #first# does not pick up on your question, then you should just let it drop.  Wait several minutes and then find something in the picture that interests you.  \"These men look really busy, but I can\'t make out what they are doing.\"  Ask #first#\'s to help to describe the action you have noticed in the busy scene.  If #first# helps, say by explaining, \"they\'re getting the bark off the logs\" then you could ask what that action might be called.

Pick out a mark or patch of paint that looks rather \"kinetic,\" that it is has a certain energy and movement in the lines.  Then propose that this mark looks like an action, e.g. \"Boy, this part is interesting.

What is it doing.\"  See if you can support this shift to action.  Perhaps #first# might say, \"on the water\" or \"hitting the water.\"','Note the complexity of #first# answers.  To say \"on the water\" implies action, at least the location of action, but does not really provide words for the action itself.  On the other hand, \"hitting the water\" is more expressive of the actual event and may even have some symbolization in the paint marks themselves.   Do not be too concerned about an obvious relation between the marks and the action.  Rather be pleased that #first# has begun to consider this relation.','It is important to help #first# develop new words for actions as well as the names of objects.  Often it is the action that provides the relation between two or more objects.  Language development can be viewed as the gradual integration of object words with action words.

(Younger children certainly benefit from being read to as well.)  Research shows that story-time appears to evoke behaviors from parents that encourage language learning opportunities--a type of tutorial behavior (Wells, 1985).  Parents engaged children in labeling objects and provided consistent feedback which helped the child know if the label was correct and provided reinforcement (Ninio & Bruner, 1978; Snow & Goldfield, 1983).  Parents tend to use different types of techniques with different ages, more naming with younger children and more open-ended questions with three and four year olds (Wheeler, 1983).  However, there were differences between the frequency with which parents engaged children in instructive behaviors and the types of behaviors which corresponded with the size of children\'s productive vocabularies (Ninio, 1980). \n\nResearchers have recently changed their ideas about they way children learn to read and write.  With this new perspective, called emergent literacy, research is now addressing literacy development, instead of just reading development.  Whereas in the past, researchers viewed the young child who could not yet read as lacking literacy skills, today researchers view children as active learners who are developing as readers and writers long before they begin formal schooling (Teale & Sulzby, 1986).\n\nChildren learn about literacy through social interactions, especially with their parents, in the informal environment of their home and community (Teale & Sulzby, 1986).  For example, research shows that children\'s literacy development is enhanced through parentchild storybook reading.  As children listen to repeated reading of stories (and most children want to hear their favorite stories again and again!), they become familiar with the language of books, which will help them when they begin to read.\n\nChildren are also exposed to print in the signs, advertisements, and labels around them in their community.  Researchers believe that children\'s growing awareness of such \"environmental print\" is the beginning of reading development (Goodman, 1986).  In a study of print awareness, 60% of 3yearolds could read environmental print, such as a toothpaste label, although fewer of the children could read the label apart from the item.  Observational studies indicate that most of young children\'s experiences related to literacy are goal directed activities, such as when they observe adults reading newspapers or writing checks.  Thus, the adult models literate behavior for the child, which the child may then pretend to do themselves.  All of these experiences and activities are part of a child\'s emergent literacy.\n\nRecent research suggests that simply exposing preschoolers to rare words during book reading does not influence later vocabulary achievement  (Tabors & Beals, 199X). Rather, certain types of conversation between parents and children during book reading is related to high levels of literacy in the child.  For example, a child who is involved in discussing what might happen next, how he feels about the story, and what the story reminds him of will be better able to produce the type of talk that is needed for advanced levels of literacy.  Research conducted with fouryearolds shows that children acquire the most vocabulary from the storybooks they hear when they are encouraged to actively respond to questions either verbally (labeling a picture of a new word) or nonverbally (pointing to a picture of a new word) while listening to the stories (Senechal, et al., 1995). Research also shows that children benefit when adults provide more information about new words (Pemberton & Watkin, 1987).  For example, adults can provide additional information through recasts (restating the child\'s speech using different words).  In this way, adults scaffold, or support, children\'s learning.  Research indicates that scaffolding by parents, such as encouraging children to speak more often by asking openended questions, repeating, expanding, and recasting children\'s statements, and praising accurate speech has a positive effect on children\'s language ability (Whitehurst, et al., 1988).  Repeated readings of storybooks also contribute to increases in children\'s vocabulary (Senechal, et al., 1995).\n\nResearch also shows that parents\' use of rare words at mealtimes directly influences children\'s vocabulary growth (Snow & Tabors, 1993; Dickenson & Tabors, 1991).  The researchers studied several families\' mealtime conversations and noticed a higher rate of rare words in conversations that involved explaining why people do things or how things work.  In a study of vocabulary learning at preschool (Dickenson, Cote, & Smith, 1993), researchers similarly found that children\'s vocabulary growth was related to the amount of analytical talk during book reading with the teacher (talk that required the children to analyze characters\' personalities and motivations, think about why people do things, predict what will happen next, and discuss vocabulary) and the teacher\'s use of rare words during mealtimes.  The researchers suggest that children most likely learn words in informal settings.  This idea, that children learn about literacy in the informal settings of their home and community, is a fundamental idea underlying research in children\'s emergent literacy.','The Captain and the Witch ','Speaking in \"Different Voices\"   ','Tina, Brian, and Zack are playing in the back yard near the bird bath.

Children more easily grasp the active voice, \"The ball hit the girl\" or \"The  truck hit the car.\"  In passive voice, these sentences would read \"The girl was hit by the ball\" and \"The car was hit by the truck.\"  Some research suggests that by age four, children are beginning to grapple with and are working towards understanding the passive voice.  Interestingly, researchers know this because four year olds tend to make certain kinds of errors when interpreting the passive voice that three year olds don\'t make (Bever, 1970).  These are called \"growth errors\" because they signal that the child is beginning to interpret the sentences in more sophisticated ways.  In a research study conducted by Tom Bever (1970; written about it de Villiers, & de Villiers, 1973), three, four, and five year old children were given two sentences worded in active voice to interpret (The girl picked the flower and The car hit the truck.)  All of the children understood the correct meaning of the sentences.  Then the sentences were worded passively (The flower was picked by the girl and The truck was hit by the car.)  Three year old children appeared to use a strategy of figuring out how to interpret the sentence by looking for meaning.  Therefore, they got the first sentence in which the girl clearly picked a flower because a flower can\'t pick a girl, but got the second sentence wrong.  Four year olds appeared to apply a grammatical rule that assumed that the first noun is the actor and got both sentences wrong.  Five year olds correctly interpreted both passive sentences, demonstrating an understanding of the grammar involved in using the passive voice.  The de Villiers asked a four year old to demonstrate the meaning of \"The truck is bumped by the car.\" The child used the truck to bump the car.  When asked to \"Now make the truck bump the car.\" she responded with \"again?\"(de Villiers, & de Villiers, 1979).  While four year olds might demonstrate such errors in understanding, it suggests that they are building more complex understanding of the rules of syntax.','Splatter or splattee ','Growth errors in understanding the passive voice  ','Tanika and Emma are digging outside in a pile of mulch waiting to be spread in the flower bed.  In their eagerness to get to the floor of the pile they kicked up a spray of debris.  Not quite simultaneously each girl gets splattered with mulch and each complains to the other.  \"Yuck, you got me all dirty!\" Tanika says to Emma.  Emma\'s mom comes over to whom Emma says, \"I was messed up by Tanika!\"   Emma\'s mom says in a neutral tone, \"Emma was messed up by Tanika.\"  Emma pauses a moment then says, \"No, She did it.\"  To which Tanika takes exception, \"Me, you mean you!\" ','The children are not unclear about what they mean but they are having trouble dealing with the passive voice.  Emma puts the object of the action (\"I\") first in the sentence because she wants to quickly affirm that she was the victim, not Tanika as Tanika had claimed earlier.  As long as these two roles, agent of action and object of action, are marked by the personal pronouns (I, you, and me) the children do o.k. with the language.  But when Emma\'s mom uses the names of both girls Emma gets confused by the passive voice.  Emma disagrees with her mom\'s sentence in spite of its agreeable message (\"Emma was messed up by Tanika.\").  Emma thought her mom meant that Emma was the culprit.  And the enigmatic sentence by Tanika \"Me, you mean you!\"  shows how the case of a pronoun (\"Me\' versus \"I\") can help a child precisely distinguish the victim \"me\" (object of action) from the culprit \"you\" (agent of action). ','The passive voice is not so common in everyday speech.  But is does occur for special reasons.  \n· When #first# wants to give emphasis to the object of action, e.g. \"No, Herbie was hit, not Josh!\"\n· When the passive voice would capture some irony, e.g. \"It was the elephant that was frightened by the mouse!\"\n· To create a sense of suspense, \"The young boy was frightened by ..... Sher-Kon.\"  \n· When #first# wants to emphasize #his/her# feelings about something that was done to #him/her#, as in \"I was left !\" instead of \"They left me.\"    \n','There will be moments when #first# is having a little difficulty with the passive voice.  This often happens in listening to stories.  The story may read, \"and the dragon was killed by the knight.\"  Later #first# might ask, upon seeing the knight in a picture later in the book, \"But he\'s dead.  The dragon killed him.\"  The problem here is not so much a lapse of memory, but rather a failure to process the passive form of the earlier sentence, \"and the dragon was killed by the knight.\"  In a book, you can return to that page and read the sentence more slowly.  In other situations, you just have to rely on #first#\'s trust when you repeat something previously said in the passive voice.  It can also help if you use gestures to embody the action, so #first# can see who is acting on whom.  Hearing a passive voiced sentence and seeing an enactment with hands or objects supports #first#\'s attempts to process the grammar.','\"That ball was really hit!\"','Finding situations suitable for the passive voice','The passive voice can be used to change the emphasis of a sentence.  Look for cases where the change makes the most sense.  For example, find some situation where you would like to place the emphasis on the recipient of action, such as saying, \"That ball was really hit.\"  The emphasis on the ball could be appropriate when the hitter is not known or when the event is mostly about the path of the ball, e.g. a close up television shot of a home run hit going into the grandstand.  ','Since you have modeled the use of the passive voice, the first response will come from #first#.  Listen for signs of understanding .  If #he/she# acknowledges the emphasis on the recipient of the action, such as \"Yeah, it went over the wall!\" then make a follow up comment that uses the passive voice again .  \"It was hit by a strong batter.\"  ','#first# might show little response to your first sentence  or might indicate that #he/she# misunderstood.  For example, #first# might say, \"No, that kid caught it.\" after you had said, \"That ball was really hit.\"  #first#\'s response could mean that #he/she# misunderstood your sentence to mean that the ball hit someone.  If you decide that #first# was a little confused by your meaning, change the sentence structure to the active voice.  \"Yeah, that ball went a long, long way.\"  You have conserved the original meaning, but have converted the sentence to the active voice.  Use both voices in parallel like this to help #first# capture the meanings underneath sentence structure.','As #first# becomes capable of both receptive understanding and active production of the passive voice you will find many opportunities to consolidate this new competence.  Listen for #first#\'s use of the passive voice.  When such a sentence is uttered and when it fits the situation, simply repeat the meaning, sometimes in the active voice and sometimes in the passive voice.  So if #first# says, \"I was watched all day,\" you could either say, \"Yes, she watched you all day,\" (active voice) or \"Yes, you were watched by your favorite teacher,\" (passive voice).','Learning to use the passive voice appropriately will give #first# power to express nuances in the relation between actor, act, and object of action.  So much of ordinary speech rests on the subtleties of these basic relation.   Sometimes one wants to emphasize the shovel, sometimes the sand; sometimes the fork, sometimes the food.  The reciprocity between agent and object of action is an early form of logic that will under gird higher forms of logic to be learned later.  ','\"He was tested by me\"','Using role play to practice the passive voice','Observe #first# playing with a friend in some situation where social or vocational roles are fairly well known by both, such as \"playing doctor and patient.\"  In these situations there is usually one role that is the primary actor and the other role more usually the recepient of the action.  Such role pairs include doctor/patient, salesperson/customer and fireman/fire victum.\nThese situations are filled with opportunities to use the passive voice.\n','Listen to the conversation.  Wait until #first# says something in the active voice, such as \"I need to listen to your heart\" when they are using the doctor/patient roles.  In the manner of an off stage comment, recast that thought, after the event occurs, as \"Jason\'s heart (#first#\'s friend) was listened to by you.\"  Note any response from #first# such as, \"Yeah, he was tested by me.\"  In most cases, the passive voice is a report to a third party, so that is why it is appropriate for you to be nearby during the play.','If #first# makes no comment you may still notice some pause in #his/her# play when you make your recasting remarks.  Look for non verbal cues as well as verbal ones.  Perhaps #first# will think about the agent of action/object of action role by switching the roles.  That is, after your comment #first# might suggest that his friend Jason now be the doctor and listen to #his/her# heart (#first#\'s heart).  Therefore you might conclude that your comment at least sensitized #first# to the agent of action/object of action relation.','You might notice that #first# begins to use the passive voice even outside the context of the action being described.  For example,   #first# could tell you at diner about something that happened in the morning.  \"I was frightened by the storm.  I screamed\"  Play with the logic of these relations, every once in a while, just for fun.  Affirm #first# emotions and then try,  \"Was the storm frightened by you?\"  Such an encounter orients #first# to the possibility of a reversal in the agent of action (storm)/object of action (#first#) relation.  That is, if the storm was frightened by #first#, the that makes #first# the agent of action and the storm the object of the action.','These encounters cause #first# to think about the relation of agent of action and object of action, and more than that, the relative weight of emphasis on either in different situational contexts.  The treatment of language as a craft with rules will give #first# a power and flexibility that is denied children who learn only at the level of a good sounding sentence.

Research shows that parents persevere in attempt to teach children these routines even when children don\'t yet follow through (Cazden, 1974).  While younger children can learn the meanings and situations when words such as \"please\" and \"thank you\" are used, a real grasp of politeness and an understanding of why it is important requires children to adopt the perspective of another person.  This may be why it is rare to see the emergence of polite forms before children reach age 4.  Politeness often involves using an in-direct approach which children, as speakers, need to learn to produce.  Up until age 4 or 5, children tend to use direct requests or imperatives.  Only around age 4 or 5, do most children begin to simple polite forms when making a request, \"May I please have some candy?\" or  \"Please give me a little candy.\" Around ages 5-6, children can use direct and indirect forms, but can\'t disguise their intentions or desires.  By ages 7-8, children can vary content and form so that they can create subtle requests hinting at what they want (Bates, 1976).  \n\nBeing polite involves not only producing polite forms of statements, but understanding indirect polite requests of others.  Often, when others are making a request, responding in a polite manner involves understanding an indirect form of a statement.  For instance, parents might say, \"Those are Grandpa\'s favorite kind of candies\" instead of saying, \"You should give Grandpa one of those.\"  Research shows that by age 3 or 4, children are able to interpret these indirect requests  (Garvey, 1975, 1984; Holzman, 1972; Shatz, 1978).  Some researchers suggest that younger children may depend more upon contextual clues in determining meaning whereas older children use context and the word meanings such that even young children are fairly successful with indirect requests (Shatz & McCloskey, 1984).  \n\nChildren do recognize the position and perspective of the person to whom they are speaking.  Research shows that 2 to 5 year olds use more imperatives when requesting something of their peers and more permission requests with people whom they perceive as social superiors (Corsaro, 1979).  When 5 year olds met up with resistance to a request, they did not vary the type of request though 9 year olds almost always did (Axia & Baroni, 1985).  Six and seven year olds were more sensitive than younger children to the context surrounding their requests, keeping in mind what the listener knew, making sure to get their attention before making the request, and showing more deference in how they asked if the request would be perceived as interrupting (Ervin-Tripp, O\'Connor, & Rosenberg, 1984).','Let\'s play Billy Goat Gruff','Learning the pragmatics of politeness','Sally, Marya, and Holly are playing together in the school yard.  They are having great fun walking on a swaying bridge that presents a moderate challenge.  Sally really wants to walk across the bridge when no one else is on it, so it will not sway so much.  \"Hey, can I go by myself?\"  The other two girls are having too much fun making the bridge sway.  Then Sally suggests, \"Let\'s play Billy Goat Gruff.  Then we go across the bridge one at a time.\"  Holly does not particularly like the idea.  So Sally extends her idea, \"Well Holly, you can be the mean guy who says he\'s gonna eat us up.\"  Holly likes that idea so the game begins.','Sally has learned the practicality of politeness.  By inventing an interesting game she was able to constraint her playmates to take turns without reducing their pleasure.  Her intentions were probably obvious, since a few moments before she had asked to walk alone across the bridge.  Nevertheless, her friends have no need or desire to compare her plan now with her request earlier.  Sally\'s plan was almost derailed by Holly, but Sally played directly to Sally by offering Holly the \"lead role.\"   Thereby the play ran a smooth course.  Such is the yield of indirect requests for compliance.','The practicality of politeness can have many forms and many occasions.  Some will be more direct than others and some will be more obvious in their intentions than others, but they will all be steps toward taking a kindly perspective towards others.  Here are examples of other likely cases.\n\n·  #first# wants to stay up and offers to brush your hair.\n·  #first# wants to have an extra desert and asks \"double pretty pleaseee.\"\n· #first# wants you to fix #him/her# a bowl of cereal and politely gets a bowl for \"you.\" \n· #first# wants to hold the hamster at school and sits real still so the teacher will notice. ','A teachable moment for politeness can sometimes seem rather indirect.  For example, say #first# is being a little too abrupt while waiting in line for a snow cone.  ##he/she## says, \"Hurry, Hurry.\"  You could simply say, \"Be patient.\"  Or you could take this opportunity to reflect on the perspective of the snow cone vendor by saying, \"The man has been working very hard here for a long time.\"  Let #first# make the relation between #his/her# command and the perspective that you have just presented.    The moment to teach is not lost when you are able to help #first# place #his/her# own interest in relation to others.  This moment to teach could be lost to a moment to preach if all you provide is the counter command, \"Be patient.\"  Social relations are complex and #first# needs your help to understand the reasons behind polite language as well as to learn the form of polite language itself. ','Aunt  Maggie, I am so glad to see you, ','The polite language of greetings','Polite language occurs somewhat more frequently in situations slightly more formal than usual, such as the language between new acquaintances at a party or between people of different generations.  Find a situation where polite language is the rule.  For example, say #first# is about to see members of #his/her# extended family that #he/she# visits only infrequently.','Prepare #first# for this new situation, e.g. model the greeting ritual or another likely micro-encounter, such as the ubiquitous \"My how you have grown.\"  Take time to explain how #he/she# should shake hands, maintain eye contact, and wait for the elder person to ask the first question (these rules vary, of course, with geographic region and culture).  You can say something like, \"Now pretend that I am Aunt Maggie.  She will be sitting most likely.  It\'s difficult for her to get around.  Come over to me, hold out your hand, and politely say to me, \'Good day Aunt Maggie, I am so grad to see you.\'\"  Such role playing will increase the chances that #first#\'s politeness will be smoothly delivered in the real situation.  However, for fear of a rigid delivery, do not rehearse more than once or twice.  You are trying to implant an idea rather than to hone a script.','If #first# is reluctant to role play, shift to an \"example in a vacuum.\"   That is, rehearse the polite encounter to the air.  \"Lets say Aunt Maggie is here in front of you.  May I listen to the polite hello that I have heard you give before, the one where you calmly look at Aunt Maggie and say hello and shake her hand.\"    If #first# cooperates you have a chance to make a gentle pointer, such as, \"I like the way you took her hand without shaking it too hard.\"  ','As #first# develops in #his/her# ability to read the perspective of others, #his/her# polite language will develop more finesse.  You can support this finesse by your comments.  Say #first# tells his Aunt Maggie about an accident #he/she# had and in the process \"cleans up\" the language using less graphic terms.  \"And my toe got caught in the bicycle spokes and my toe looked ....... really bad (instead of, \"all yucky blood\" as #he/she# said to you.)  Your comment could be, \"#first#, I do appreciate how you choose your words carefully just then.\"','Polite language takes many forms.  #first# will learn these forms and realize that being direct and being polite are sometimes at odds.  This may be confusing because on many occasions #first# will be asked to be more direct.  But learning the balance between polite discretion and explicit directness will serve #first# well as #he/she# develops long term social relations.  ','\"I can\'t find the bread in this store.\"','Using indirect requests as a form of polite language','The will be times when #first# is playing out a scene, somewhat like a script that perhaps you have heard before.  Some of these scenes will be re-enactments of situations where an amount of politeness and deference is usually shown between the characters in the script.  For example, #first# may be pushing a toy doll or animal from here to there in a carriage on the way to the pretend grocery market or clothing store.  There is usually some sort of exchange between mixed ages on these outings, either on the way or upon arrival to the site.  ','Find an opportunity to enter the play, if #first# gives you some signal that acknowledges your presence.  Be satisfied to merely observe if #first# is pretty much \"on a roll.\"  If you can enter then set up a situation that requires #first# to consider the meaning of a polite, somewhat indirect request.  Let the context develop around the reason you and the toy are communicating and then include your indirect request, \"I just don\'t know where the bread is in this store.\"  See if #first# \"reads\" this as a request for #his/her# character\'s help or some other form of assistance.  Or you might say, \"I have an itch in the middle of my back.\" ','If #first# is does not treat your comment as an indirect request, then move to the direct request, \"(Name of toy), Do you know where the bread is in this store?\" or  \"I can not reach it to scratch it, (name toy)\" or even more direct \"Could you scratch my back, (name toy)?\"  Later try again with an indirect request.  #first# may have become sensitized to your indirect requests given #his/her# initiation from the direct request.','Check on the quality of the reactions to your indirect requests.  Remember that old joke about the taciturn hillbilly.  When asked by a hiker, \"Do you know the way to South Bend,\" the hillbilly leaned by in his rocking chair and said just one word, \"Yup.\"  Reading a question or statement as an implied question is requires a level of perspective taking.  Some of these requests are more subtle than others.  For example, \"I can\'t reach that book next to you.\" is slightly more direct than \"There\'s the book I was looking for.\"  Take a mental note of what type of indirect requests #first# can figure out.','Indirect requests form the art of social politeness.  Once #first# learns to read their implied meanings, social exchanges will become smoother and miscommunications less frequent.  #first# will grow beyond the literal meaning of a sentence and begin to consider the implied needs of the person speaking the sentence.

Children\'s first uses of the word \"if\" are often around 30-36 months and are interchanges with the words \"when\" and \"because.\"  Later children begin to predict possible future events (\"what if it snows...\") or other ways of doing activities (\"what if we pretend to be robbers instead\") (French & Nelson, 1985).  Once children are able to produce \"if,\" they quickly master the underlying syntax and then are able to create more complex deductions (Scholnick & Wing, 1995).  Between the ages of 4 and 5, children learn the grammar of the hypothetical (deVilliers & deVilliers, 1979).  Children\'s sentences begin to contain the construction \"If x happens, then....\"  For instance, a child might say, \"If it rains tomorrow, I won\'t go to camp\" or \"If I eat my dinner, can I have a cookie?\"  Children\'s early inferential statements and most complex inferences tend to relate to themselves as in these examples.  After age three self-referential statements decrease, but children\'s inferences are consistently more self-referential than adults (Scholnick & Wing, 1995).  Understanding and constructing hypothetical statements involves certain elements of cognitive growth and logical competence such that even for languages in which their construction is fairly straightforward, children don\'t tend to construct them until age 4 or 5 when they have achieved the underlying concepts (Slobin, 1966).  For instance, it assumes an understanding of time that involves past, present, and future in that conditional statements are often about past or future events as they relate to present events or statements.  Researchers suggest that the ability to produce what follows the \"if\" reflects an ability to plan (Markovits, 1983).  Research shows that children are able to think about making plans for the future by around age three (deVilliers & deVilliers, 1979).  However, in order to make such hypothetical statements, children need to understand conditional situations, where one event is dependent upon another--contingencies and causal relationships.  Children need to be able to distinguish between contingent and noncontingent event relations and to perceive temporal relationships between clauses (Emerson & Gekoski, 1980).  These understandings begin to appear between 4 and 5 years old.  According to longitudinal studies, children come to understand factuals first (if it rains, we wear our raincoats).  These are instances when \"if\" can be replaced by \"whenever\" or \"because.\"  Next, children learn uncertainties (if we can find the toy you want, we will buy it).  These are instances when the certainty of the if related statement is in question (we don\'t know if we\'ll find the toy).  Finally, children learn counterfactuals (if it were raining, we would wear our coats.  These are instances when one believes the opposite is true and is speaking hypothetically (It isn\'t raining, but if it were, we would wear our coats.) (Bloom, et al., 1980; Bates, 1976; Scholnick & Wing, 1991).\n\nEarly if-then conversations can help children learn conditional logic.  Parents become \"models of reasoning\" for children (French & Nelson, 1985).  Parents illustrate the logic of the hypothetical by warning children, \"If you do x, y will happen.\" Then when the child ignores the parent and y happens, the parent often instructs, \"see what happened when you did x? Y happened.\" (Falmagne, 1980, 1990).  Most of children\'s inferences were based upon premises that adults generated, so the child\'s linguistic environment is very important for influencing children\'s ability to make inferences (Scholnick & Wing, 1991).','If the fire opens the world','Learning the grammar of the hypothetical   ','Tim has drawn his version of a volcano based on a program he saw on television.  His father is interested in Tim\'s picture and asks him about it.  Dad, \"What do you have here son.\"  Tim, \"That\'s a volcano.\"  Father, \"What\'s a volcano?\"  Tim, \"Well, the earth\'s got fires inside it and the fires blow up and open up the world and the fires are coming from under the world and there are gases and acid in there.\"  Father, \"Oh my, that\'s something. Then what happens?\"  Tim, \"Well if the fires open, the fires open up the world, then we wont have any place to live.\"  Father, \"If the volcano fire opened the world it would destroy everything.\"  Tim, \"Okay.\" ','Tim understands something about volcano\'s as an event, an event that has a source, an action, and (when asked) a consequence.  He states the consequence as an \"if - then\" grammatical construction.  For proposes of our judging his language development, it does not matter too much that the consequence is larger than life (\"won\'t have any place to live\").  But it is significant that he says \"if the fires open, the fires open...\"  The complete thought is \"If the fires open the world, then we will have no place to live.\"  But he can not quite integrate the thought about fire with the thought about living space.  He has to sort of back up, get a running start on the second attempt where he omits the word \"if\", and then say the complete thought.  It takes a lot of concentration to focus and integrate his knowledge about volcanoes with his knowledge about the supply of living space.

Detecting Taxonomic Relations','Research (e.g. Bauer & Mandler, 1989; Ross, 1980; Younger, 1993) suggests that by 12 months old, babies are able to recognize perceptual categories.  Because most children do not have the language skills to tell you what they understand, researchers have designed clever studies to assess children\'s understandings.  One study (Ross, 1980) considered how long children looked at certain objects in relation to how novel the child perceived the object to be.  They showed children categories of objects in which one of the objects did not fit in the grouping.  Children stared longest at the object that didn\'t fit.  Bauer and Mandler (1989) showed one year olds sets of three objects, pointed to a target object (such as a monkey) in the center, and asked children to find one \"just like it.\"  The other two objects were purposely chosen to represent a taxonomic relationship (such as a bear) or a thematic relationship (such as a banana).  Eighty-five percent of the children chose the taxonomic relationship.  The words \"just like it\" as especially important here because research shows that when children under 6 are asked to choose objects that \"go with\" another object, they tend to choose on the basis of a thematic relationship (e.g. Smiley & Brown, 1979).  Other research by Barbara Younger and colleagues suggests that by 10 months of age, babies already have a sense of categorization as groupings of the \"same sort of thing\" (Younger, 1993; Younger & Cohen, 1983).  They presented 10 month olds with category members and non-category members (animals that had characteristics discrepant with the category).  The infants were able to disregard the nonmembers.  They suggest that this means children actively compared and categorized the stimuli.   Researchers disagree as to whether infants\' ability to detect taxonomic relations means that babies hold a conceptual understanding of categories (e.g. Younger, 1993) or whether this means that children hold an implicit sense of categories and recognize that something is or isn\'t part of that category (Gopnik & Meltzoff, 1987; Mandler, Bauer, & McDonough, 1991, Sugarman, 1981, 1982).  Researchers also disagree about the techniques that infants use to make the distinctions that they do, for instance whether children abstract information from a prototype or use generalizations from examples (Younger, 1993).  The sum of the research suggests that children may tend towards certain techniques but may well be capable of different techniques for detecting categories (Siegler, 1991).

In this research, the twelve month olds used simple strategies that did not increase in complexity but by 14 months of age, children tried increasingly complex approaches with each trial.  A study by Koslowski and Bruner (1972) found that children started with simple solutions on a lever rotation task and as they failed, explored increasing complex approaches.

It appears that children have some ability to recognize quantity differences between 2 small sets of elements by the time they are between 16 and 18 months old.  Researchers (Strauss & Curtis, 1984) studied this question by repeatedly showing 16 to 18 month old infants two different squares.  On one square, there was one dot depicted.  On the other square, there were two dots depicted.  The babies were reinforced each time they selected the square that had more dots.  Then, they presented babies with squares depicting three and four dots.  The babies demonstrated an ability to select the square that had more dots.  The finding that children can select out which square has more in supported conditions such as these when comparing just two objects suggests that babies have a developing understanding of the property of more or less (Cooper, 1984).  \n\n \nYounger children seem to know that the quantities are different  from each other but not more or less (Cooper, 1984).  Researchers (Antell & Keating, 1983; Strauss & Curtis, 1984) have explored the development of this ability in infants 6 to 8 months of age, and have seen that infants can discriminate between 2 rows of dots that have different quantities of elements.

[See Related Logic &Number LW- 6 months- Perceiving One to One Correspondence.]  Infants were first habituated to a row of dots numbering between 2 and 6, and then were shown a second row of either more or less dots than in the first row.  The infants in these experiments dishabituated to the new row of dots, indicating that they detected the change in quantity of items in the collection.  Research by Starkey et al. revealed that infants between 6 and 9 months were able to perceive inequalities among two sets of items, regardless of differences in the color, shape, size, surface texture or arrangement of the objects in the sets. These findings suggest that between 6 and 9 months, infants have the ability to abstract the numerical properties of a set of  diverse items and relate the quantities of the two sets to one another in order to detect inequalities (Sophian, 1992; Starkey, et al. 1990).  \n','Emma is upset that her father ate some of her pretzels.',NULL,'Emma is sitting on her fathers lap with three pretzels in front of her.

Mounoud and Hauert (1982) examined children\'s ability to anticipate the weight of an object by handing a series of large and small objects in increasing and decreasing order to infants, and observed how the infants adjusted their grasp for large and small objects.  The researchers observed that upon grasping the objects, the speed of movement and the drop of the arm in 9 -13 months old was proportional to the weight of the objects, while 14-16 month old infants were able to grasp the objects of various weights without a significant difference in speed or arm drop.  Mounoud and Hauert suggest that this indicates a difference in ability to predict weight based on size, as the younger infants distinguished the weight of the objects during, rather than before, the grasping action, while the older infants first predicted the weight of the object based on it\'s size and adjusted their grasp of each object accordingly.  These differences in behavior suggest that by 14-16 months of age, children\'s ability to predict and accomodate perceived size and predicted weight is quite developed. \n\nMounoud and Hauert (1982) also tested this ability by examining infants\' reactions when a heavy object, to which they had been prompted to grasp several times, was replaced by an object identical in size but lighter in weight.

Sorting Objects Into Spatially Distinct Groups (Expressive)','Infants first begin sorting objects into groupings around 18 to 24 months.  Sorting of objects during these months does not mean children were previously unaware of categories.  Infants demonstrate sensitivity to different attributes as early as three to four months old (Bomba 1984: Bomba &Siqueland 1983) and are forming more complex categorizations by nine to ten months of age (e.g. Young 1990).  Infants from 12 months old begin to group objects that are similar to previously contacted objects rather than solely\ngrouping objects that have a prominent physical feature (Sugarman 1981).  This becomes evident when children pick many similar objects from two or more classes one after the other (Sugarman 1981).  Twelve month old infants also rarely separate objects into distinct spatial groups.  Grouping is seen in the order in which they manipulate objects (Ricciuti 1965).  For example, a child may pick out 3 balls from a larger group of objects and place them aside.  Subsequently, the child will pick out 3 blocks and place them with the balls.  Between 18 and 24 months, your infant will begin to separate one sub-group away from the larger group into a distinct spatial group (Ricciuti, 1965).  This is a simple, yet significant display of grouping which is the foundation for future complex groupings (Ricciuti 1965: Sugarman 1981).  It is significant in that infants are not using language in forming groups thus, suggesting that grouping structures are independent of language structures.  Language is a component in forming more complex groupings (Ricciuti 1965).\n','Hans likes his carrots separate from his beans.',NULL,'Hans and his father Jaap are eating supper together.

According to a review by Whyte (1995), children are coming to understand the sceond rule by about 14 months of age (Poulin-Dubois & Schultz, 1988) but still do not understnad it completely by 16 months (Golinkoff & Harding, 1980).  The first rule is understood around 17 or 18 months of age (Sexton, 1983).  These rules appear to guide children\'s behavior in relation to objects, whether they assume that an object moved itself, was moved, or has to be moved.  As pointed out by Whyte (1995), the classification that Premack asserts assumes that childrne will make some classification errors when it comes to objects that don\'t follow the rules exactly, such as in the examples provided by Whyte (1995) a balloon moved by the wind, a candle blown out by wind, clouds in the sky.','Expectations about movement of objects',NULL,'Jenny is at the playground playing with her big soft beach ball.

Collection-groupings means putting all of the toys together whereas a class-grouping implies a hierarchy and involves understanding that a doll is both a toy and a doll.  The relationship is not mutually exclusive because the doll is both a doll and a toy.  While children are able to construct both types of relationships, their errors suggest that they tend to interpret classes as collections and find it hard to think of an object as being in more than one category at once.   This has been referred to as the \"mutual exclusivity bias.\" \n\nResearchers (Callanan & Markman, 1982) asked 2- to 4- year olds questions about five hierarchies that children should be familiar with. Each hierarchy had an upper level (i.e. drinks) and two lower levels (i.e. milk and juice).  Even though children were able to interpret class-inclusions, they made errors at doing so, particularly when questions were asked at the top level of the hierarchy (i.e. Is this a toy?) whereas fewer errors were made at the lower levels of the hierarchy (i.e. Is this a doll?).  About 25% of the time, 2- to 4-year olds interpreted the higher level relationships as collections, not class-inclusion relationships and about 16% of the time, they had difficulty with the lower level relationships.\n\nAccording to Markman (1989), children need to ignore many linguistic and nonlinguistic cues available in natural settings.  The finding that children make the error as often as they do, given cues to the contrary, suggests that collections provide a powerful means to help children think about relationships and that the acquisition of language supports children\'s growing ability to override difficulties of  the \"mutual exclusivity bias\" and to learn class-inclusion relationships (Markman, 1985).\n','It Must Be Me','Eliminating All the Wrong Ones','Zack is playing with a set of Russian dolls, nested cups with matching tops.  He has isolated three top pieces and is just fooling around with them, placing one over the other or one inside the other.  Then he sees a tiny motorcycle that he often zooms over the carpet.  He zooms this toy over to the middle size top and hides the motorcycle under it.  Immediate thereafter his sister calls to him from the next room.  He stands to see what she wants, peers in her direction, and sees no urgent reason to leave.  He returns to his three top pieces.  He now looks at three tops, all on their base, each the potential hiding place of his motorcycle.  He has forgotten where he placed the tiny motorcycle.  But he remembers that it was under one of the three tops.  He lifts the largest one, nothing there.  Then he goes for the smallest one, only to find nothing again.  But now, with a laugh and a ready right hand, he lifts the middle size top with his left hand at the same time he swoops his right hand down to reclaim the motorcycle that he knew must have been there.','Zack understands that no one had moved his toy motorcycle.  He also knows that it was under one of the tree top pieces.  This knowledge is general.  That is, he does not think that it was under a particular top piece, but was under one of the class of these items.  Therefore, if he failed on any (ANY) two of these tops, then he is certain that the toy is under the last one.   We can judge his certainty by the way he approached the last top, compared to the more tentative way that he approached his first two choices.  In a words, Zack is using a type of logic.

Perceiving Relational Similarity','An important form of reasoning has to do with perceiving analogies or structural similarities between events. Researchers (Goswami, 1992) have questioned what young children\'s understanding of analogies looks like and whether they are capable of using structural similarity as a basis of reasoning.  Simply put, can young children perceive that something is structurally similar to something else and reason about this similarity?  Usha Goswami (1992) refers to this as \"relational similarity\" and argues that children can perceive structural similiarities.  She cites recent research by Ann Brown (1989; 1990) which provides insight on these questions.  Brown gave children a problem in which they had to use a pulling tool to pull toys to them.  First, she had children learn to use an appropriate pulling toy to pull a toy to them, either with their mother\'s help or without.  Then they were given a new set of tools to pull the toys towards them.  One of the tools was structurally similar to the first tool.  Another one of the tools was perceptually similar in that it had the same set of stripes, but it was not the tool that would help the child with pulling.  Most all of the children (92%) chose the structurally similar, pulling tool.  The youngest children in this study were 17 to 24 months of age.  Particularly interesting is that children were able to \"override\" perceptual cues rather than being distracted by them and could consider the structural and functional relationships between the objects.\n\nThis finding is important because it suggests that children are developing the ability to find commonalities, in this case what functioned as a pulling toy in each instance, and then use that information to solve a new problem.  They were able to pay attention to the relevant information (what would enable them to pull) and to \"transfer\" it or use it to solve a problem.  Instead of attending to superficial characteristics, they focused on what mattered and used the similarity to solve a problem.  \n\nIt is important to remember that this is a developing ability and depending upon the complexity of the problem, children may or may not notice the similarity.  When problems are more abstract, even adults have difficulty doing so!  Researchers explain that in order for children to transfer solutions to analogous problems, they must first notice the similarities between the tasks and then map the relations between the two problems.  When given perceptually and structurally similar solutions, children can identify these similarities in order to transfer the solutions learned in one context to the next (Brown, et al., 1986; Brown & Kane, 1988; Brown, 1989).  In several of these studies, preschool children were read a story and then presented with an analogous problem task which required them to transfer a solution from the story (Brown, et al., 1986; Brown and Kane, 1988; Brown, 1989; Crisafi & Brown, 1986).  One study  (Crisafi & Brown, 1986) presented subjects with perceptually different but structurally similar problems.  When subjects were unaided by the experimenter, the youngest children (2 3 years of age) performed significantly lower than the older (4 5 years of age) children in the transfer of analogous solutions across problems, indicating that the younger subjects may not perceive the structural similarities as readily as the older subjects.  In the aided condition, however, where subjects were explicitly told by the experimenter that the two perceptually different problems types were alike, but not told what the similarities were, the performance differences between age groups were minimized (Crisafi & Brown, 1986). In another study which prompted children to notice structural similarities by asking children to instruct a puppet to solve an analogous problem, children performed significantly better on a transfer task than children that did not instruct the puppet.  These results suggest that children notice structural similarities when prompted to do so (Brown & Kane, 1988).  The findings of these studies  indicate that when experimental conditions cue children to look for structural similarities, children as young as 24 months can identify and utilize this information in transfer tasks.\n\nThese findings  indicate that young children have the ability to transfer learned solutions from one context to the next, but must first perceive the similarities between the tasks in order to know when it is appropriate to do so.  The research suggests that children do not always notice similarities spontaneously and benefit from reminders to look for similarities.  Depending upon the complexity of the problem, they are able to notice functional similarities as well as surface features.\n','The Off Brush','Finding the object that works','Corkie pulls a brush through her hair, her favorite brush with Disney characters brightly painted on the broad back of the yellow brush.  She has performed this ritual many times and loves to use this particular yellow brush.  One day she enters her room and she sees a yellow mirror with the same Disney characters as on the brush, a matching item from a Disney brush and mirror set that her visiting cousin brought.  The mirror is facing with its reflective side down.  Except for the lack of bristles, it looks rather like the brush.  But Corkie frets until she sees a second new object, a brown brush also brought by her cousin.  This brush is clunky and plain, but Corkie still goes for it, picks it up, and uses it to stroke her hair.','Corkie picks up the brush that does not look like her usual brush.  She avoids the mirror that looks very much like her brush.  We have to ask how did she do this.  Even at this young age, Corkie has engaged in form of analogical reasoning.  She has ignored the very obvious features (yellow, Disney characters) and thought about what makes a brush a brush.  Her thinking about the function of a brush causes her to choose only the object that has the necessary physical features, the bristles.  Her thoughts about how a brush works helps her to over-ride the very salient look of the yellow, Disney brush.  In other words, she is trying to find an object that matches her concept of \"brushness\" rather an object that matches her remembered image of the yellow brush.

Now consider those features that are not relevant to the function of the object, the color, decorative curves that do not add to its function as a tool.  Now find some way to stage a reason for #first# to choose between two objects, one that looks like the usual tool by virtue of its functional features and one that looks like the usual tool by virtue of its decorative features.','Say you place next to the pegbench a mallet with a tiny little head, a head that is really too small to accomplish much work.  And next to that you place a fist size wooden cylinder with no handle.  The cylinder, if held flat face out in the palm could be used to beat the peg into the pegbench, like a pestal in a mortar bowl.  Be sure that the usual mallet is not there.

','These activities will encourage #first# to use a more abstract level of thinking about the similarity among objects.  #first# will begin to think about the way that things work and how a physical feature either helps or hinders the work that the object needs to accomplish.

On this particular day #first# watches a grasshopper in the summer sun, leaping in a high arch from here to there.  ##he/she## points and says \"Chewy.\"  Obviously the grasshopper does not look like #his/her# cat, but the poncing action reminds #him/her# of what Chewy does.  #first# has made an analogy between the grasshopper and the cat.','If you have a sense of the analogy you can venture forth with a short comment that consolidates this relation for #first#.  \"It jumps like Chewy,\"  you could say.

Even if you are wrong in guessing what #first# was thinking, you are at less presenting the idea that their is some basis for the similarity.','If you think #first# has some sense of analogies, that is, some sense of how things can be similar without being an exact copy, then offer #him/her# one or two examples.  Watch #first#\'s eyes.  Notice what #he/she# notices.  If #he/she# looks interested in something like a falling leaf you could say, \"Oh, that looks like your kite.\"  Try to refer to some experience in the recent pass.','As #first# thinks more and more about analogies you might be able to ask #him/her# about something that has an analogous relation to something else.  Do not expect too much at this age, but there is no reason not to ask.  For example, if you see the falling leaf, you could ask #first# what it reminds #him/her# of.

When you encourage #first# to think about new ways that objects and events can be viewed, you are in effect increasing #his/her# flexibility of thought.   In many cases where #first# has to solve a problem some form of flexible thinking will be helpful, such as treating a hammer as a paper weight on a windy day.

One of the earliest number concepts to develop is one to one correspondence.  Children learn to match objects one to one before they learn to use number words, for instance, a child can hand out one cupcake to each child in a day care group, matching one child to one cupcake--as long as mom or dad sent enough--and may be fascinated by placing one ball in each cup, even though the larger cups can hold more than one ball.  One to one correspondence is one of the most basic principles behind counting.  Counting involves matching one numeral to one object.  Research by Gelman and Gallistel (1978) shows that when dealing with very small numbers of objects, two to three objects, two year olds can correctly match a counting word with an object.  They were correct in matching 80% of the time.  This does not mean that they used the words that we formally use to count or that they used them in correct order, but they did match or tag each item with a word.  For instance, they might use letters or number words but not in order such as one, five.  Matching in this way is more sophisticated than it might initially appear. According to Gelman and Gallistel, it requires partitioning off or separating the objects and then matching or tagging each one a word.  When two year olds made mistakes, they commonly make two types.  The first kind had to do with partitioning.  They would skip an item or tag it more than once.  The second kind involved mismatching, for instance, not counting the last item or counting beyond the last item.  Occasionally, a child made a tagging error in which they assigned the same tag more than once, for instance counting \"two, four four.\"  Gelman and Gallistel point out that this error looks like a partitioning error but it is a special kind that appears to result from mismatching. It is important to keep in mind that this research was with very small numbers of objects.  The numbers of errors children made went up when the numbers of items went up.  So while children can demonstrate some emergent concepts of one to one correspondence, typically parents will still notice errors especially with sets higher than three.  By age three, children successfully partitioned and tagged item sets of three to five (correctly 88% of the time).  Once set sizes reached 7 items, three year olds did not perform as well as 4 year olds.  This research also found that two year olds were more likely to use their own made-up count words than were three and four year olds.  In addition, for small sets, the youngest children were more likely to depend upon counting to come up with a response than older kids who may have been better able to recognize small amounts without counting. The research showed that children were able to use one to one correspondence whether or not the items were lined up and whether or not they were homogeneously or heterogeneously grouped (Gelman & Gallistel, 1978; Gelman & Tucker, 1975).  The research shows that children understand the concepts of partitioning and tagging even if they are lacking skill in applying them and make mistakes as set sizes increase.  When set sizes increase, children tend to have more difficulty with one-to-one correspondence than with maintaining the order of the number words.

It is also noteworthy that the shoes in no way \"provoke\" the one to one correspondence.  That is, the animal figure does not fit snug in the shoe the way a marble would fit into a depression in a Chineese checkers board.  In this latter case, there would be no way to physically place two marbles in a single depression.

By 16 months, children are more likely  to search for an object in the correct place if they were allowed to correct earlier errors (Webb, Massar, & Nadolny, 1972).  In searching for an object in a limited number of places, 16 to 24 month olds didn\'t make very many redundant searches (Berenthal & Fischer, 1983).    Willats (1990) reports on a study by Willatts, Domminney and Rosie (1989) where children  (mean age of 26 months) were tested on their approaches to solving a problem where they had to get a toy by rotating a tray or by using a straight lever.  Half of the children made approximately 3 attempts and did not repeat approaches that they had already tried.  The rest of the children made about 8 attempts but nearly half of these were repeated approaches.  The researchers reasoned that these repeats are not because children couldn\'t remember what they had already tried because the percentage of repeats was different for different types of solutions.   Some solutions were more direct than others, such as reaching or climbing on the table whereas others were more indirect, such as fiddling with the pivot screw on the platform.   The most direct approaches (for instance, just hopping up and trying to grab the toy) were most likely to be repeated.  This suggests that kids were thinking about why and approach might have failed and that retrying it could be successful.  How capable children appear in monitoring progress depends in part on how difficult the task is.  In hide-n-seek type games, even 2 and 1/2 year olds made redundant searches when there are many places to search (Wellman, Somerville, Revelle, Haake, & Sophian, 1984.)

Bancroft (1985) recorded children\'s interactions with their parents between 24 and 42 months.  Children\'s language included references to concepts such as order (what\'s first?) and duration (how long?) as well as things that happened in the past.  For some children, these concepts were present as early as 24 months old.  For most children, they began to show up around the beginning of the third year. & Montanegro, 1992).  \n\nSato (1988) studied the development of preschool children\'s use and understanding of time concepts and found that by four years old,  preschool children begin to use concepts such as time of day, day of the week and month of the year with an understanding of the temporal relationship among events.  It was evident that although four year old children in preschool could name the days of the week, they could not always report what day it was when asked.  Although these children could not yet tell time, Sato observed that they were able to identify what they might be doing at certain time throughout the day in relation to routine activities.\n\nResearch on children\'s use of the temporal terms does not imply that children can actually reason about time.  Several researchers have tested children\'s ability to reason about temporal concepts in order to examine the developmental changes of temporal understanding.  The findings of these studies suggest that children develop the ability to sequence familiar events in forward temporal order (from first event to last) typically between the age of two to three years (Fivush & Mandler, 1985; Friedman, 1985). They found that this ability developed prior to the ability to sequence a familiar event in backwards order (from last event to first) and prior to the ability to sequence a novel event in forward order, both of which typically develop around age three.  By age four, the researchers observed that children were able to sequence novel events backwards, which requires children to manipulate the temporally organized representation of the event rather than simply recall the information, in order to reason what the order of events would be in reverse.  \n\nFriedman (1990) conducted research to determine when children include information regarding duration in their temporal representations. Children were presented with cards that illustrated 6 daily activities (waking up in the morning, eating breakfast, eating lunch, eating dinner, taking a  bath, and going to bed) and were asked to judge the amount of time separating the occurrence of these events in a typical day.  The results of this task indicated that by three to four years of age, children are able to include information about the duration of the time separating daily activities, which Friedman explains, may not indicate an understanding of the homogeneity of time across all events, rather that young children represent duration as separate \"islands of temporal information\" for each event (Friedman, 1990).  \n\n \nIn order to assess children\'s ability to reason about and manipulate the concepts of temporal order and duration, five to seven year olds were tested on a study where the children were asked to help a certain duck get to a feeding area first.  Children were able to manipulate order and duration to successfully solve the problem (Bancroft & Slowen, 1993). \n\nFrench (1989) tested children\'s ability to answer when-questions by using mini-stories that were manipulated to influence children to answer with before-type or after-type responses.  Results suggest that children three to five years of age tend to respond to when-questions with after-type responses, even in the story situations designed to elicit before-type responses.  French observed that when children gave before-type responses, they were more likely to be erroneous than when giving after-type responses.  When prompted to specifically give before-type responses with questions such as \"what happened before...\", children tended to answer correctly most often in the before-story situations than the after-story situations.  French concludes from these findings that children\'s responses to when-questions do not to answer with after-type responses.     \n\nUnderstandings of time continue to evolve throughout childhood (e.g. Maurice-Naville ','Seeking  Explanations of Cause and Effect  ',NULL,'Valerie is playing with her spoon at breakfast.

There is a marked increase in the amount of \"causal talk\" that children engage in between the ages of 33 and 40 months of age (Dunn & Brown, 1993).  At around 30 months, children begin to produce questions aimed at finding out why particular events have occurred (Hood & Bloom, 1979).  Researchers have determined this through a combination of naturalistic studies (Hood & Bloom, 1979) and by asking parents to track children\'s questions in a kind of diary (Callanan & Oakes, 1992).  Research by Callanan and Oakes (1992) shows that there is an increase in the percentage of why questions asked by children between the ages of three and four (52%, and 73%, respectively) in speech episodes recorded by their parents.  A slightly lesser percentage were asked by five year olds (67%).   They report that even for the youngest children, the questions were articulated were more than just \"why?\" questions.  Instead they were articulated more fully to indicate the causal phenomenon that they were seeking answers to.  For instance, \"Why are they cutting down that tree?\"  Preschoolers were certainly found to be interested in issues around motivation and asked many of tese types of questions.  However, while earlier research (Bloom & Capatides, 1987; Dunn, 1988; Hood & Bloom, 1979) suggested that most of children\'s questions are about social phenomemon (why someone did something; why they are sad, etc.), the Callanan and Oakes research found equivalent numbers of questions about physical domains (why something is broken; why it is dark).  Earlier research also suggested that many of children\'s early why questions are about violated expectations.  For instance, when a mother puts her hair up and the child wants to know why her hair is gone or a child asks, \"Why you not go to bed now, too?\" at his or her bedtime.  Recent research (Callanan & Oakes, 1992) did not find this and more research is needed.\n\nResearch on how parents respond to children\'s questions of causality (Callanan & Oakes, 1992) suggests that most often, parents respond to children\'s questions with explanations about mechanism (what made something happen) prior cause (what happened before to cause a given effect).  However, how parents responded changed with age with parents of four year olds offering more complex causal explanations than parents of three year olds.  It was less common for parents to talk with children about what could happen in the sense of predicting consequences.

[See Related Logic & Number LW on other counting principles- 24 Months- Demonstrating One to One Correspondence; 30 Months- Learning that the Order of the Numbers Matters; 33 Months- The Last Number Tells How Many; 36 Months- Knowing What is Countable; 48 Months- Knowing that the Order of Counting Doesn\'t Change the Quantity.]  One of these principles is that the order in which counting words or tags are read off doesn\'t change.  This means that we always count one, two, three... and don\'t sometimes change the order, for instance, two, three, one...  Children\'s understanding of early number concepts has been carefully studied by Gelman and Gallistel (1978). They found that children as young as two and a half understood that number words follow a consistent order when dealing with set sizes of two to three objects.  They termed this the \"stable order\" principle.  Understanding the stable order principle does not assume that children know the number words that a culture conventionally uses.  Gelman and Gallistel attributed children with understanding the stable order principle if children consistently used a sequence to tag items whether that sequence was nonstandard (for instance, a made-up set of words), standard but not what we conventionally use (for instance, using the alphabet), or the number words we conventionally use in our culture.  Their research suggests that most children attempt to use conventional number words when the set sizes are small enough, but may switch to an idiosyncratic list as the set size increases and they run out of number words.  This is particularly the case with two year olds as opposed to three and four year olds.   When set sizes increase, children tend to have more difficulty with one-to-one correspondence than with maintaining the order of the number words.

If you can recognize those situations when it is going on you can help #him/her# by summarizing #his/hers# befuddlement and by reviewing the method by which #he/she# could find out.  This review often includes some mention of the transformation that dictates whether the current object is the one #he/she# wants, such as \"your sister just moved it over there when you were not looking.\"    The distinction between \"two\" (this is another) and \"twice (here it is again) is a fundamental concept that needs your support.','Is That One Yours','Dealing with Choice between Look Alikes','The confusion between reality and appearance can occur when one object has been superficially changed in how it looks (mud on a tricycle) or when one object has been displaced, rotated, or actually exchanged with a similar one while #first# was not looking.  This second case contains its own special challenge.  Lets say that #first# returns to the snack table but now where there had been only one cup of juice, there are two that look very much alike.   ##his/hers## cup is exactly where #he/she# placed it, near the edge of the table, but the new cup is actually closer to where #he/she# is standing now.','If #first# starts to reach for either of the cups without giving it much thought, ask #him/her# to wait.  \"Wait, do you know which one is yours?\"  See what #first# will do.  Encourage #him/her# to think back on where #he/she# left #his/her# cup.  ','It is possible that when you ask #him/her# to think about which cup is #his/hers#, #he/she# will only shift #his/hers# hand to the alternative cup.  If this happens, then it is appropriate to say, \"I think I remember that you cup was close to the edge of the table.\"  While you have provided #first# with the critical information yourself, you are also modeling how #he/she#might think in so similar situation in the future.','If you notice that #first# seems to enjoy these little challenges, you could invent a few games that require #first# to figure which of two objects is the one #he/she# wants.  For example, establish that only one of two pink juices actually has a nice taste.  Then see if #first# can find the better tasting juice.  The challenge occurs when #first# has to watch where you move the preferred glass or how you might put three or four \"confederate\" glasses around the one #he/she#left in an unchanged spot.','These encounters will help #first# think about \"same one\" versus \"similar one.\"  This distinction is fundamental and is a requirement for solving many of the little problems that #first# will face each day.  Knowing whether this is \"my juice\" or \"your juice\" certainly will make social encounters with friends much smoother.

This question has led to interesting research to try to determine whether children are misled when the surface appearance of something is not what it really is.  While earlier research suggested that preschoolers had limited ability to distinguish between the two, more recent research suggests that to some extent, they can differentiate.  Siegel and Share (1990) gave children food that now looked fine but previously had been shown with a problem that contaminated it.  Children watched as a cockroach was removed from a glass of orange juice.  Even two and a half year olds said that even though it looked okay, it really was not okay to drink.  Other research (Woolley & Wellman, 1990) shows that three year olds use the terms \"real\" and \"really\" to distinguish between what is make-believe and what is not.  Additionally, three year olds know that sometimes we believe something to be so that isn\'t so.  For instance, if we think a certain item is in a certain place, we\'ll look there for it, even if it isn\'t there (Siegel & Beattie, 1991; Zaitchik, 1991). This recent research demonstrates that fragile and developing ability to distinguish between reality and appearance is present in young children.  However, the earlier research demonstrated that slightly more difficult tasks revealed limits in preschooler\'s ability to think about appearance and reality  For instance, in one of the earliest studies, DeVries (1969) showed preschoolers a cat named Maynard.  After the children were familiar with Maynard, she put a dog mask on him.  Three year olds thought that this changed Maynard\'s identity, that he would bark instead of meow, eat dog food instead of cat food, and so on.  Flavell, and colleagues found similar results.  Three year olds ran into difficulty distinguishing between a rock that looked like a green sponge, an orange crayon that looks black, and so on.  In each case, three year olds said that the thing was the thing that it looked like, while four year olds distinguished between what some thing really was and what it looked like (Flavell, 1986).','And Last Make Four','Thinking about the total number','Sophie is leaving the school auditorium where her brother had just played in the band concert.  As she approaches the last row she starts to slaps the back of each aisle chair and counts, \'One, two, three, .. (when she arrives as the last row), FOURrrr. \"    Later, as she walks down the steps to the foyer she counts again, \"one, two, three, three.\"','Sophie was doing more than assigning each chair or each step a number word.  She was also thinking about the total number of items she had counted.  That is why she emphasized the word \"FOURrrr\" and why she had repeated the word \"three.\"  These language markers indicate that this last word represents the cardinal value (total number) of the set of objects counted.  You will also find that children at about this age also begin to deal with the ordinal value of a set of objects, e.g. first, second, third, etc.  You might hear this in \"you go second, I\'ll go first.\"','• #first# counts the number of bottles #he/she# found and gives you a report, \"five\" which you know means the entire set of bottles\n• #first# counts #his/her# toes, \"one, two, three, four, five,\" wiggles them, and says \"five\" once more.  ##he/she## is asking you to enjoy the whole set of #his/her# numerous toes.',NULL,'Recounting the Count','Dealing with changes in number','You will notice that some times #first# will count just to count.  #he/she# is not trying to get a total for a set of objects.  For example, in a counting rhyme like \"one, two, buckle my shoe\" #first# is just practicing the order of the number words.  On other occasions it will be obvious that #first# is interested in how many of something #he/she# has, such as \"four pencils.\"  Watch for an instance of this latter type of counting.','The general objective here could be to provoke ,first to recount after you change something about the set of objects.  If #first# has counted four pencils, add one more and invite #first# to tell you how many object #he/she# has now.  Or you could put one object to the side and invite #first# to tell you how many.  Do not specifically ask #him/her# to \"count\" the objects because, if #first# is really good with numbers #he/she# knows that #he/she# does not have to recount the original set.  ##he/she## can just say the next number \"five\" if you added one or say the privous number \"three\" if you subtracted one.  If you specifically tell him to recount, #he/she# might not use this more advanced strategy.','Realize that it is slightly more difficult to deal with subtracting one item than adding one item.  This difficulty exists for several reasons.  For one, #first# might see your removing one item as an unfriendly act, as if you have denied him access to that item, an item #he/she# likes.  For another, if you just place it to the side, so #he/she# knows that #he/she# can play with it later, #he/she# will have a hard time supressing #his/her# urge to count an object that #he/she# can clearly see, even if it is put to one side.','A more advanced version of this game is to add two items are substract two items before you invite #first# to tell you how many #he/she# has.  Another variation would be to add a new item that is not that similar to the original set.  For example, if #first# has just counted four pencils, add a crayon and invite #first# to tell you how many makers  #he/she# has.  If possible, find a new items that has a name, like \"makers\" in the example, that can apply to all of the objects.  That is, both pencils and crayons are markers.','You are staging a situation where #first# could either recount from the begining or use a \"counting on\" strategy.  The \"counting on\" strategy is rather advanced so do not really expect it this soon.  The :\"counting on\" strategy requirse #first# to remember the total number of the original set and then just step the count up one or down one depending on how you changed the original set.  The reason this is difficult is as follows:  #first# now has to that the total value of the original set (four, in this example) and convert four to an ordinal value, that is, the number just before the new last number.   Now four is not the cardinal value (the total in the set) it is now the value from which you begin the new count and continue until all the added items have be counted: \"four,..... five,  Five!\"   This switch in the meaning of four requires some pretty high level thinking, but could be a benefit of playing these games with #first# ','Eggs for Count','Thinking about when to stop the count','Find some situation where #first# might have a reason to compare the total of two different sets of objects.    A good case would be when #first# has to find create a one to one placement between two sets, such as an egg for each nest in the egg cartoon.  Use a same number, such as a half dozen eggs for a half cartoon.  ','See if you can get #first# to figure out how many eggs #he/she# needs to fill up the egg cartoon.   At this point #first# might begin to count the nests in the egg cartoon, \"one, two, three, four, five, six. .... SIX.\"  You say, \"o.k. you need six eggs to fill up the cartoon. Give me six eggs. \"  You are asking #first# to place the eggs in your hand, not in the cartoon.   If #he/she# places the eggs in the cartoon  #he/she#does not have to think about when to stop counting out the eggs.  If #he/she# places the eggs in the cartoon, one egg at a time, #he/she# could just stop counting when there are no more nests remaining in the cartoon.  This cue would eliminate the need for #him/her# to think about the total value of the six eggs that should equal the total value of the six nests in the egg cartoon.  See if #first# knows when to stop handing you the eggs.','If #first# counts a few less or a few more than six when you ask #him/her# to hand the eggs to you, then you can simplify the problem by asking him to place one egg at a time in the nests in the cartoon.  You should then notice  when #he/she# places the last egg that #he/she# pronounces the number with greater emphasis, e.g. .... four, five, SIX!\"  However, remember that you can not assume that #first# is thinking about the total value of the eggs in this situation.  But you can at least assume that #first# is thinking about this egg as being the last egg.  Since their are no places left in the cartoon. #first# is telling you that #he/she# understands that this number has a significance not held by the previous numbers.  ','Later you can try situations where the places for a set of objects can vary, such as egg cups that are separate.  After asking #first# to count out the number of eggs #he/she# needs for five egg cups, remove the eggs, add one cup, and ask #him/her# again for the number needed to fill each and every cup.  Does #first# have to recount the six cups or does #first# understand that if there were five before and you just added one, that means that the answer is just the next number past five.  ','You are dealing with the relation between ordinal value of number (first, last) and the cardinal value of number (the total amount in a set).  These concepts are sometimes confused by young children.  Games such as these will help #first# think more clearly about number relations and reasoning with number.  Be patient and realize that with your support these concepts will become integrated into the elegant system we know as counting.  And by counting we mean more than reciting the number words.  We mean being able to think about concepts such as first, last,  more, less, and equal in a variety of situations.  But we are not yet talking about adding and subtracting.  It is enough that #first# understands that because the number four comes after the number three, this means that four is more than three.  It is not important at this stage that #first# knows that four is one unit more than three, or that five is two units more than three.  These quantitative concepts will be learned much later.

Research by DeLoache, Sugarman, and Brown (1985) studied the strategy use of 18 to 42 month olds when trying to fit together a set of nested cups.  The children used six different types of correction strategies.  Three of these involved backtracking and were carried out primarily by children older than 30 months of age.  Making a correction depends first on recognizing that they\'ve made a mistake (DeLoache, et al., 1985)!  Children were more successful recognizing errors on the nesting cup task than they were on fitting together a set of rings. \n\nWhile some research (Heth & Cornell, 1980) suggests that babies as young as 12 months of age periodically backtrack, it is not commonly seen in two year olds (Berenthal & Fischer, 1983; Corrigan, 1981) and does not appear to become a commonly used strategy until 30 months of age.  \n','Return of Magic Pony','Using a photography to locate a missing toy','Francine had not thought about Magic Pony for some weeks.  Magic Pony, a little figure toy, had been the main character in many a story that she had drammatized in her pertend play in her bedroom.  On this particular day her father brought back some photographs of Grandma\'s visit. The family sat on the sofa in the living room to look at the photographs.   One of them showed Grandma sitting in the dining room.  In the background of the photo, on the dining room hutch, Francine noticed her forgotten toy.  \"Magic Pony\" she cried out.  She jumped up from the sofa, ran into the dining room and found Magic Pony still there next to the flower vase.  ','Francine has exhibited a remarkable new competence in thinking, a type of analogical thinking.  She did more than recognize Magic Pony in the photo.  She treated the photo as a map for a real space.  The photo was a spatial analog to her house, specifically, her dining room.  The fact that she left the living room and went to the hutch in the dining room tells us that she treated the photo in an \"as if\" manner.  That is, she knew that the photo did not \"contain\" her forgotten toy, but by treating it \"as if\" it were the same space as her house, she then had some confidence that she could actually find her toy in the dining room.  At a younger age she might be able to say \"Magic Pony is in the living room.\"  But this remark, by itself, does not demonstrate that she is treating the photo as a spatial analog to her own house.  She could be, more simply, just naming the items in the photo.

For instance, when we count, we often stress the final number word in recognition that it also tells how many there are.  Gelman and Gallistel (1978), who extensively studied children\'s understanding of counting and number concepts, call this the \"cardinal principle.\"  Gelman and Gallistel\'s research suggests that when counting very small sets of 2-3 objects, children may demonstrate understanding the cardinal principle as early as two and a half years of age.  They found that by three years old, most children (83%) understood it such that they could demonstrate their understanding directly and indirectly.  They used repeating the last number word (one, two; two!) and/or giving emphasis to the last number word (one, TWO!) as direct evidence that children understood the cardinal principle.  Indirect evidence included attributing the correct number of items to the set or counting during one trial and then later telling how many objects were in the set without counting.  Four year olds often showed indirect evidence instead of direct evidence, perhaps because they were not inclined to count very small sets and could come up with the amount without actually going through the process of counting out the items.

They are able to use one object in the place of another, look at photographs and know that they represent people and things, and to use words to \"stand for\" different objects.  Between 30 and 36 months of age, a new form of understanding about representation emerges.  Researcher Judy DeLoache refers to it as \"representational insight.\"  DeLoache\'s research (1987, 1989, 1990, 1993) shows that prior to this time, children do not understand certain clearly representational objects as representational when they serve another function as an object itself.  An example of this type of representational object is a scale model, where the model is a \"real\", three-dimensional thing unto itself, yet also serves a representational function at the same time. both an object and a representation of the room by giving a sample of 3 year old children extra experience with the model, encouraging them to play with it for 5 to 10 minutes before the standard task began.  The children in the experiment who were given the extra experience with the model performed significantly lower on the model task than did the group of children that were not given the extra experience with the model.  DeLoache concluded from these results that interaction with the model as an object separate from its relationship with the room made it more difficult for 3 year olds to interpret it as a representation or symbol of something else.\n\nDeLoache concludes from her extensive research that the understanding and use of a representational symbol depends on several factors, including the understanding that an object can be both a real thing and a representation of something else;  the amount of  surface similarity between the an object and its representational model; the level of awareness of the similarities between the object and its representational model; and the amount of experience with the model as an thing itself.\n  \n\n \nDeLoache (1990) found stark differences between the performances of 30 month and 36 month old children in an experiment in which children were required to retrieve a hidden doll in a room after watching the experimenter hide it in a scale model of the room. The older subjects were significantly more successful on the retrieval task  (75%) than were younger subjects ( 15%).  DeLoache tested the same ability in subjects 33-35 months of age and found that their performances (38%), although slightly better than the younger subjects of the first experiment, were still quite lower than those of the 3 year olds. The \"all or nothing\" nature of these results, where some subjects performed extremely well and others performed extremely poorly, suggest that during this age children are developing the ability to simultaneously see an object both as a thing unto itself and as a representation of something else.  It is this ability that allowed subjects to perform successfully on the retrieval task using the model, as subjects who spontaneous indicated an understanding of the model-room relation found the hidden doll 75%, and subjects who did not give evidence of this understanding found the doll 15%.  \n   \nUnderstanding that a model can be both a thing unto itself and the representation of something else with a similar structure requires analogical reasoning ability, where the child needs to recognize and reflect upon the relational similarity between the object and its representational symbol (Goswami, 1992).  When testing the effect of similarity between the model and the room on children\'s retrieval performance, DeLoache (1990) found that 3 year old children\'s performances were more strongly effected by perceptual similarity than by spatial similarity.  Children performed significantly better when the object was hidden in a room in which the furnishings were the same or when the object was hidden behind (under) a corresponding piece of furniture than did children who searched for the hidden object in a room that had different furniture or when the object was hidden in corresponding spatial position.     \n\nTo further test the effect of similarity on the ability to use the model as a representation of the room,  DeLoache (1990) presented a sample of 3 year old subjects with the standard model task without explicitly pointing out all the similarities between the model and the room (as was done in the original experiments).  Performance of this group of subjects was 25% successful retrieval, significantly below the 75% performance of 3 year olds in the standard model task  The findings of these experiments suggest that 3 year olds perform well on the standard model based on explicit awareness or perception of surface level similarities and on the basis of an object to object correspondence. \n\nMost recently DeLoache and Burns (1993) tested 3 year olds\' ability to simultaneously see the model as ','The Return of Magic Pony ','Using a photograph to locate a missing toy','Francine had not thought about Magic Pony for some weeks.  Magic Pony, a little figure toy, had been the main character in many a story that she had drammatized in her pertend play in her bedroom.  On this particular day her father brought back some photographs of Grandma\'s visit. The family sat on the sofa in the living room to look at the photographs.   One of them showed Grandma sitting in the dining room.  In the background of the photo, on the dining room hutch, Francine noticed her forgotten toy.  \"Magic Pony\" she cried out.  She jumped up from the sofa, ran into the dining room and found Magic Pony still there next to the flower vase. ','Francine has exhibited a remarkable new competence in thinking, a type of analogical thinking.  She did more than recognize Magic Pony in the photo.  She treated the photo as a map for a real space.  The photo was a spatial analog to her house, specifically, her dining room.  The fact that she left the living room and went to the hutch in the dining room tells us that she treated the photo in an \"as if\" manner.  That is, she knew that the photo did not \"contain\" her forgotten toy, but by treating it \"as if\" it were the same space as her house, she then had some confidence that she could actually find her toy in the dining room.  At a younger age she might be able to say \"Magic Pony is in the living room.\"  But this remark, by itself, does not demonstrate that she is treating the photo as a spatial analog to her own house.  She could be, more simply, just naming the items in the photo.   Using the photo as a guide to her search is a higher order of competence.','Using analogies begins to happen in many places.\n\n• #first# can play a treasure map game if the space is familiar\n• #first# says,  \"the beetle wobbles like a fat person.\"\n• #first# says, \"I hope it snows again today\" when  #he/she# sees the telecast of yesterday\'s blizzard.\n  EEs for LW2    33 - 35 Months  Logic/Number\n',NULL,'Let\'s build a stairway today.','Using a drawing as a set of instructions','You have noticed on several occasions that #first# has demonstrated an ability to see the analogy between a drawing and a real space.

While researchers have disagreed over when this understanding develops, there is a fair amount of evidence to suggest that three year olds recognize that diverse things can be counted (Gelman & Gallistel, 1978; Gelman & Tucker, 1975; Macnamara, 1974; Baroody, 1992).  Researchers Gelman and Gallistel (1978) refer to this as the \"abstraction principle,\" the idea that any set of objects, real or imagined, can be counted.  Earlier research suggested that preschool children could not count heterogeneously grouped objects (Gast, 1957; Klahr & Wallace, 1973) and that counting ability was linked to ability to categorize.  Other research suggested that the diversity of the objects had a negative effect on their ability to count (Siegel, 1973).  Research by Siegel showed that it took longer for children to count the heterogeneously versus homogeneously grouped objects. \n\nIn a review of this research, Gelman and Gallistel (1978) suggest that the youngest children were easily distracted by the irrelevant information available because the set was diverse.  They explain the earlier findings as an artifact of the experimental design which asked children to first count homogeneously grouped objects and then to count heterogeneously grouped objects, thereby confusing the children (Gelman & Tucker, 1975).  Their research showed that children did not hesitate to count diverse objects, which differed either by color alone or by item type and color.   Other studies have shown that children as young as two years old perform above chance levels when asked to count \"how many all together\" in two sets of objects that differ in size and shape (Sophian, 1988; Geary, 1994; Baroody, 1992).  The results of these studies conclude that preschoolers are able to count collections of diverse objects and that this ability does not differ from the ability to count collections of identical items.  \n\n \nThe findings of research on the abstraction principle suggests that children can include in a count any item to which they can apply the term \"thing\" (Gelman & Gallistel, 1978).  Shipley and Shepperson (1992) conclude from their research on the development of counting, that from early in life humans are able to quantify any set of items that can be perceived as discrete and physical objects.  In support of this claim they cite a study by Starkey, Spelke & Gelman (1980) in which 8 month old infants were able to perceive inequalities between small sets of  heterogenous objects.  These studies suggests that young children process individual objects separately and are able to include any number of diverse and discrete physical objects in a count early in the development of their counting ability.

They also demonstrate some knowledge about what is in their minds and what is in the minds of others.  Children begin to use the terms \"think\" and \"know\" when they are still two years old.  Research shows that around three, children do understand that if one person looks into a box and another person didn\'t, then the person who looked knows what\'s in it while the person who didn\'t look doesn\'t know (Pillow, 1989; Pratt & Bryant, 1990).  According to John Flavell (1988), this shows that three year olds realize that we need to have a \"cognitive connection\" to the information in order to \"know it.\" This understanding is fairly fragile and depends upon exactly what is being asked.  For instance, until about age five, research shows (O\'Neill, Astington, & Flavell,1992) that children have difficulty telling whether they would have to see or feel something to know about its color or its texture.  (However, if the information were in front of them, they could respond appropriately to showing the blue one or the rough one.)  \n\n \nWhen three year olds are asked to take the perspective of another or figure out what another person would know based on certain information, they tend to run into difficulties.  For instance, three year olds do not understand that having certain prior knowledge or a particular perspective influences how people understand and interpret events (Ruffman, Olson, & Astington,  1991).  By age four, children have learned more about how to think about others\' minds.  Wimmer and Perner (1983) did some interesting research on what they called the \"false-belief paradigm.\"  Children saw a story in which a child puts a marble in a basket and then goes away and another child comes and moves the marble to a box.  When asked where the first child will look for the marble when she returns, it is not until age four that children say that the child will look in the basket where she left the marble while younger children expect her to look in the box.  This suggests that by four, children are more successful at predicting what others know and how their beliefs will influence their actions. \n',NULL,NULL,'Julie watches her younger brother playing with a ball that he loves to place in a cup.

So for instance, if a child sees a glass sitting on a table and later sees a broken glass with a hammer sitting next to it, at what age can they infer what has happened?  They conducted a series of research studies that suggest children develop this ability between the ages of three and four.  In order to find out, they showed children a photograph of an object, then a second photograph depicted the object in an altered state (for instance, broken or wet or cut.)  Children were also shown possible objects which could have caused the change (for instance, a hammer, some water, a knife.)  In order to be sure that the child was comparing the initial state of the object to the end state, instead of just picking the picture of the object that could break something or that matched the object (a broken cup because the first picture was a cup), the researchers showed objects that had two conditions but changed in only one way.  So for instance, they were shown a wet cup, then a wet broken cup.  The child needed to compare and see that the change was that it was broken and select the object that could have broken it.  Next, the child was shown a broken cup, then a wet broken cup.  Now the child would need to choose the water as the thing that made the cup wet.  Three year olds relied on the end state of the object more than the difference between the initial and end states. Four year olds, on the other hand, attended to the difference between the two to reason about what happened.   \n\nThe question of when children make such causal inferences is particularly interesting because the topic of what children understand about causality and when they understand it has been the focus of a great deal of interest on behalf of cognitive researchers.  There is striking evidence that young children are sensitive to causal relationships from the first months of life (e.g. Bower, 1980; Leslie & Keeble, 1987; Lawson, 1980). [See Logic &Number LW - 9 Months-Growing Causal Perception.]  At very young ages, children react with surprise when their causal expectations are violated.  For instance, if they witness a sequence of events that includes an event that appears uncaused.  By age two and a half, researchers have found that in their everyday scripts and expectations about how things work, children show clear expectations of what should happen based upon causal knowledge (Price & Goodman, 1990).  By age three, children use information about how often two events occur together (or covary) to think about what thing makes another thing happen (Schultz & Mendelson, 1975).  \n\nResearch by Bullock, Gelman, and Baillargeon (1982) suggest that children demonstrate expectations based upon adult-like principles by the time they are preschoolers even if they can\'t necessarily talk about what they understand.  By adult-like principles, they mean that children understand the following kinds of concepts: that causes tend to precede their effects (an understanding of priority or temporal ordering) (Bullock & Gelman, 1979); that one can look for the thing or \"mechanism\" that caused the effect; and that they expect that physical events are caused such that they are unwilling to allow for causeless events (determinism). \n',NULL,NULL,'Kate walks her bedroom to find her slippers torn.

What children can do, however, differs in degree from what they typically do when reasoning about categories. It appears that the most commonly used form in early childhood is reasoning from prototypical exemplars. This means that the child reasons from a clear example of what the category stands for to determine other category membership.  For instance, the family car may provide an exemplar for \"cars.\"  Research suggests that children can understand other techniques, just that they rely upon them less as discussed further below.\n  \nResearchers who study categorization (e.g. Rosch et al., 1976) distinguish between three category levels.  These include the \"basic\" level such as \"dog\", the \"superordinate\" level such as \"animal\", and the \"subordinate level\" such as \"poodle\" or \"sheepdog.\"  Developmental research shows that children tend to learn basic level categories first (Mervis & Rosch, 1981).  Ellen Markman (1989) reviews a number of reasons why this might be so.  She suggests that it is the most natural level at which to label objects, that this is the level around which it is easiest to form a concrete image, and that this is the level at which it is easiest to quickly define the object.  Basic categories  also have the most parts in common with other members of their category while they share less common features with members not in their category (Rosch et al., 1976).  Markman cites research demonstrating that children are better able to group objects from the same category together when they shared parts or have a similar shape (Tversky & Hemenway, 1984).  Beyond this, the features of categories are not arbitrary.  Instead they correlate with one another (Rosch & Mervis, 1975).  If a creature has a beak and wings, it is unlikely to have fur.  Markman (1989) has referred to these as \"natural kinds.\" The basic level category is considered a good trade-off between reducing similarity to other categories and maximizing similarity within categories (Markman, 1989; Rosch et al, 1976).\n\nResearch (Rosch et al., 1976) shows that three and four year olds can successfully classify at the basic category level.  Four year olds but not three year olds were able to categorize at the superordinate level. \n \nHowever, this depends in part on other variables within the task.  When children were asked to categorize using four different categories instead of two, even five and six year olds ran into trouble with the superordinate level, though not the basic level.  Research by Horton and Markman (1980) suggests that children learn basic level categories by considering exemplars while learning superordinate categories is helped along more by linguistic descriptions.  It is suggested that this is because the superordinate categories are more perceptually diverse, inclusive, and abstract (Markman, 1989).   \n\nIn some sense, children\'s tendencies and preferences have masked what they are able to do and researchers have had to devise clever means to find out whether or not children are capable of the techniques of categorization that adults use.  These different techniques include reasoning from defining features (the object\'s necessary and sufficient features for making it what it is), using probabilistically related features (so if an object had a bunch of features that are \"game-like\" it must be a game, reasoning from examples (seeing prototypical examples of dogs helps one to define what a dog is), and using informal theories (reasoning from what we believe about how the world is supposed to work.) (For an excellent review, the interested reader is referred to Siegler, 1991).  It turns out that given the right kinds of information and tasks, children can use these techniques (even when as young as one year old!)  However, children may not have the content knowledge that they need or may simply prefer to connect objects thematically (the cup goes with the doll because she drinks from it) or in chains (by certain attributes until a new attribute catches his or her eye and he or she switches to that attribute.)  Indeed, research shows that prior to age 6, children prefer thematic sorting over taxonomic sorts.  However, after age three, children typically assume that labels refer to the taxnomic relationship.  Therefore, research has focused on both what children can do and on what they typically do.  \n  \n','That not an animal, it\'s a dog.',NULL,'Henny and her brother were walking their toy horses through the rubble of the bedroom floor.

This has been an issue of some disagreement amongst researchers, but it appears that preschool children are capable of this type of reasoning when given support to help them remember the problem parts (Trabasso & Bryant, 1975).   \n\nThe early findings of Piaget (1967) suggested that children 4-6 years old couldn\'t make transitive inferences such as those above.  In Piaget\'s experiments, when shown 2 relative pairings (A>B and B>C) and asked which member of a third pairing (AC) is longer, young children were unable to perform transitive reasoning, failing to logically add the relations of AB and BC to deductively reason the relation of A to C.  This led to the view that four to six year olds understood relationships between objects and concepts in absolute terms (Breslow, 1981).  For example, \"bigger\" and \"smaller\" are seen as two exclusive attributes of objects by the preoperational child, who would not understand how an object could be bigger than some things and smaller than others at the same time (Breslow, 1981).  Therefore, transitive inferences, such as \"B>A\" and \"B<C\" would seem contradictory to the child because B is both larger and smaller at the same time (Breslow, 1981).  \n \nHowever, more recent research by Trabasso and Bryant (1975) indicates that young childrens\' difficulty making transitive inferences is not a reflection of their inability to reason, but a result of the limitations on their memory capacity.  They conducted experiments with four year old children similar to those of Piaget, using five sticks rather than three and presenting four paired relationships (A>B, B>C, C>D, D>E) to subjects.  Because the experimenters believed that the problem for these children was limited memory capability, a training phase preceded the testing, attempting to help subjects retain the relationships between the various pairs of sticks.  The results of these experiments suggested that when precautions are taken to minimize problems of memory, children as young as 4 years old can make transitive inferences (Trabasso & Bryant, 1975). Several studies have been conducted using variations of  Trabasso and Bryant\'s methodology and have yielded similar results and conclusions (Gelman & Gallistell, 1978; Harris & Bassett, 1975). \n\nThe results of these experiments suggest that despite Piaget\'s theoretical belief, young children can perform transitive inferences.  Trabasso explains that what is critical to young childrens\' ability to transitively reason is the ability to construction a linear order of items as well as the ability to create and recall from memory an accurate representation of the relationships of these items in a given premise (Trabasso 1975).  \n',NULL,NULL,'Buddy sat on the front steps and rolled a ball down from the top.

As he marched up the steps he counted in the reverse order, \"one, two, three, four, five, six, seven\" as his foot hit the top of the landing.  His father realized he had begun at the bottom this time and thought to ask \"I thought the top was number one.\"  Buddy looks at his father in amazement and says, \"Same thing, they\'re just steps.\"','We should be comfortable concluding from Buddy\'s comments that he understands that the total number of a set does not change when you change the order in which you count that set.

No matter where you start, if you tag each item, using the number words in a stable sequence, the last number you end up with will be the same and that it doesn\'t matter which item ends up with which tag because it\'s the final quantity that matters.  Researchers Gelman and Gallistel refer to this as the \"Order-Irrelevant\" Principle.  In a series of pilot studies by Gelman and a more comprehensive investigation by Gelman and Gallistel (as reported in Gelman and Gallistel, 1978), most  four, and five year olds were able to demonstrate some understanding of this principle.  Three year olds were able to demonstrate some understanding as well though they were less likely to be successful in the experiment due to counting errors and were less likely to explain their reasons for why the order of the objects doesn\'t matter.  The explanations offered by four and five year olds generally recognized that any object could be one, two, and so on, because it doesn\'t matter when counting.  While the researchers concede that the understandings do not have the level of sophistication of adult understandings, they do represent a grasp of the \"Order-Irrelevant\" Principle.\n\n[See Related Logic & Number LW on other counting principles- 24 Months- Demonstrating One to One Correspondence; 30 Months- Learning that the Order of the Numbers Matters; 33 Months- The Last Number Tells How Many; 36 Months- Knowing What is Countable; 48 Months- Knowing that the Order of Counting Doesn\'t Change the Quantity]\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'#first# might pass your question off with such a casual reaction that you are not sure #he/she# senses its significance.

Instead of needing close physical contact, they tend towards psychological contact.  This could be a kind of \"checking in\" with a parent to show him or her something the child has found or to tell him or her something (Bischof, 1975; Bretherton & Ainsworth, 1974).  Parents may feel as though their child \"needs\" them less because at this age children are so much more willing to move out and explore.  However, it is exactly because the child knows that the parent is accessible that the child is able to move out.  The child needs the parent to be a secure base in order to feel safe and comfortable exploring.  Researchers have shown that when a screen is placed between a toddler and his or her parent, children tend to explore less even when the child is sitting in a room full of toys (Carr, Dabbs, & Carr, 1975)!  The children tended to compensate by talking to their parents more.  \n\nChildren need parents to be more than just physically present.  They need parents to be accessible.  The caregiver needs to make his or her emotional expressions available to the child (Carr, Dabbs & Carr, 1975; Sorce & Emde, 1981).  This is related to the child\'s need to engage in social referencing to help he or she assess the safety and comfort of given situations (Boccia & Campos, 1989) [See Related Social LW, 10-12 Months- Social Referencing]. When parents read a newspaper and purposefully did not attend to the child, children explored less, became distressed, and tried to establish face to face contact (Sorce & Emde, 1981).  \n\nChildren become increasingly able to tolerate brief separations over the coming months (Clarke-Stewart, 1973; Marvin, 1977).  When parents physically left the laboratory for a few minutes, 12 month olds needed more reassurance upon return than did 18 month olds who just needed brief contact with a parent (Sroufe & Waters, 1977).  It\'s important to remember that children were in a laboratory environment which was unfamiliar to them.  \n','Gillian Starts Daycare.',NULL,'Gillian’s father Rhys has been taking care of her while he works from his home office.

While Rhys is there, Gillian is more likely to play with the different toys, interact socially with other children, and move around the new room.

It is common for toddlers to point things out to their parents, talk about things, or bring things to their parents for the parent to inspect (Rheingold, Hay, & West, 1976).  They delight in sharing what they have found out with their parents and love when their parents get as excited as they do.  This process has been called \"affective sharing\" (Waters, Wippman, & Sroufe, 1979) and is an important part of a toddler\'s social and emotional growth.  Developmentalists suggest that these behaviors are important because they not only signal the broadening world of the toddler, but also the toddler\'s ability to understand that emotions can be shared and to acknowledge the perspective of another (Sroufe, Cooper, & DeHart, 1992).  By this age, youngsters know some things about sharing.  They know that they need to direct their parents\' attention to the object.

While they don\'t tend to play directly with other children yet, they tend to engage in object-centered interaction (Bronson, 1981).  In this type of play, they may both focus on the same or similar objects or may simply play near each other with different objects periodically showing each other their objects.  Most play is still solitary (investigating objects, etc.) or parallel in nature (playing near another child perhaps with similar toys or a similar game, but not with them)(Brownell, 1990).\n\n \n Around 14 to 19 months, children often play with objects that are replicas--a toy cow, a doll, cars, etc.  Around 19 to 24 months, children begin to use objects symbolically (Fein, 1981).  This means that a block can be used as a car or a box as a house.  However, children still tend to use only one object as a pretend substitute.  As they reach 28-30 months, they are beginning to be able to construct more complex relationships--ones involving greater abstraction.  For instance, they begin to substitute two objects in relation to one another.  This means that a block might be the car and a clothespin or clay blob might be the person riding in the car.  They begin to construct other kinds of relationships, for instance, a collection of dolls might represent different parts of a family and hold different roles (Dunn & Dale, 1982).  There is even some evidence to suggest that children as young as 24 months may be able to keep track of pretend transformations (such as pretending to empty a bucket or refill a bucket and then keeping in mind if it is \"full\" or not) (Leslie, 1988) though other research suggests that they may not yet respond appropriately at 24 months (DeLoache & Plaetzer, 1985).  \n\nBased on the work of Marianne Lowe, Catherine Garvey (Lowe, 1975; Garvey, 1990) describes the following patterns in children\'s play.  Between the period of 9 months and 36 months, children increasing differentiate between which action patterns go with which objects (i.e. tea cups go with drinking tea while cars go with driving); learn to combine functional objects together (i.e. all the plastic tools together or all the eating utensils together); creates sequences of action patterns to create larger sets of actions (waking up, eating breakfast, and getting dressed becomes one set); learns to attribute actions to more abstract actors beginning with the self, then replicas (first he would pretend to sleep, then he makes a doll pretend to sleep; then the doll has the power of intention--deciding to sleep because it is tired.); learn to imagine appropriate objects or actions in complete action patterns (i.e. eating imaginary pie with a real set of utensils); and transforming real objects to make them fit into pretend sequences (i.e. using a plastic fire ladder as a fork to eat the imaginary pie.)  \n',NULL,NULL,'Nanette is visiting her cousin Linda, who has a pretend kitchen set up in her parents kitchen.

They become aware of their separateness and of their own agency--that they can make things happen.  Children come to recognize themselves as well as develop a sense of others.  Interestingly, research shows that 14 month olds show a preference for imitation.  Researchers (Meltzoff, 1990) had two adults sit across the table from 14 month olds and gave the adults the same toy as the fourteen month old.  One adult imitated the child\'s actions while the other did something different.  The children looked and smiled more at the adult who imitated them, suggesting that they preferred the imitation.  It is difficult to know exactly wha this means.  It\'s possible that the imitation was interesting to them partly because they understood the separate agency of the imitating adult and thus were amused by the imitating or saw it as a form of reaching out.  It\'s also possible that they viewed it as trying to play with them and like them.\n\n \nChildren tend to become aware of their intentions and the distinctiveness of their behaviors during toddlerhood.  They often want to do things for themselves and will let others know.  Research shows that as early as 15 months of age and by 21-24 months of age, children show signs of self-recognition when looking in a mirror.  Researchers have discovered that if they put a spot of rouge on a babies nose (Amsterdam, 1972) at 9-12 months, none of the children react to it, by 15 to 18 months, about 25 % of the children react, and by 21 to 24 months 75 % of the children react (Lewis & Brooks, 1978).

By the second year, children understand the actions of others as separate from their own.  Between 2 and a half and three, the understanding that people are independent agents emerges.  Children can understand that two different people play different roles and can hold a different set of intentions, beliefs, and so forth. \n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:11','2012-08-22 12:30:11'),(2714,'s_15_1','Social Rules about Standards','Research conducted on children\'s behavior in their everyday settings suggests that at around 14 months old, children start to be concerned with and ask questions about standards (Dunn, 1988).  At this time children begin taking active note of misplaced Items, possession, items that are broken, and so forth.  The number of communications that children initiate about such things increases dramatically over the next 7 months (to eight times the number of communications made at fourteen months.)  Other researchers looking at children\'s behavior in experimental settings noted this behavior at about 19 months of age (Kagan, 1981). Children show concern about items that aren\'t where they\'re supposed to be, broken things, dirty things, or things that were taken by someone other than the person who rightfully owned them (Dunn, 1988).  Mothers often discussed what the problem was as children drew attention to it.  In the case of 14 month olds who weren\'t talking, the child might point to something out of place and the mother would respond by leaving space for the child. For instance, \"That\'s not for playing with is it?\" or \"What a silly place for a shoe!  Shoes don\'t go on the table do they?\"  According to Dunn (1988) by the time children were 18-20 months of age, they sometimes teased their parents by misplacing items, contradicting their parents and insisting or justifying why something could go where it was. \n\nIn play situations, children grow particularly concerned over possession.  Research shows (Bronson, 1975) that during the second year, the intensity of children\'s concerns over who something belonged to, their frustration and anger increases sharply. Often the struggle was more to mark ownership than either child really wanting to play with the object!\n \nChildren\'s communications about standards demonstrates that they understand a lot about what their physical and social world is supposed to be like and that it is a topic of discussion when things are not as they should be.  It also demonstrates a strong emerging self as they communicate about possession and begin to defy and tease parents about the order in the world.\n','Sam tells her mother she knocked over the water',NULL,'Sam is in the kitchen with her mother Carol.

Researchers differentiate between social play and social pretend play.  Social play emerges earlier and does not involve elements of pretense (Howes, 1985).  For children to notice others and interact with them in play is not entirely new at the onset of social play.  Children have been playing interactive games with adults since the first year of life--such as peekaboo or hiding and finding.  They have been noticing other children for quite a while now as well.  Even very young babies tend to notice and get excited by other babies.  However around 14-16 months, children\'s play begins to take on a more interactive character--children take turns responding, imitating each other, and so forth (Singer & Singer, 1990).  While most play is still solitary (investigating objects, etc.) or parallel in nature (playing near another child perhaps with similar toys or a similar game, but not with them), some of this early play has shown initial signs of interaction such as imitative responses to playmates and turn-taking (Brownell, 1990; Eckerman & Stein, 1990).  So, for instance, one child might set up a block and knock it over and then the other child might imitate the action.  Children\'s actions become increasingly complementary and interactive.  For instance, children might engage in running and chasing each other, copying different motions, testing out whether they can do the same kinds of things as each other, hiding and finding each other, tossing toys around and in the case of boys, engaging in a rough and tumble play (Garvey, 1990).    \n\n \nChildren\'s pretend play also continues to grow at this time, but this pretend play is often solitary.  Solitary pretend play tends to peak at about three years of age (Scarr, Weinberg, & Levine, 1986).  In fact, even though social play is emerging, much of children\'s play continues to be solitary.  For instance, a child may pretend to bathe a doll, to move sand in a dump truck, or to work by using a play hammer to bang in plastic nails.  Sometimes, children pretend around each other, but the pretend is usually about different themes.  Around 25-36 months, children begin to engage in early social pretend play around shared themes (Singer & Singer, 1990).  These early themes are usually about familiar activities children have witnessed, one child might play the mommy and the other, the daddy.  Research by Jacqueline Sachs and colleagues (Sachs, Goldman, & Chaille, 1985) shows that it can still be a challenge for two year olds to play around a theme--that they disagree frequently.  By three, children are able to stick to a theme for a brief period.  As children get a little older, the length and sophistication of play around themes grows. \n','Cooper hands Meghan a block.',NULL,'Cooper and his friend Meghan are playing in the kitchen with a tub of small brightly colored wooden cubes.

The onset varies with different cultures and appears earlier in cultures where babies are in constant contact with their caregivers (Ainsworth, 1967).  It emerges in all cultures by 12 months of age (Kagan, Kearsley, & Zelazo, 1978; Schaffer & Emerson, 1964).  It tends to peak at about 15 months of age in most cultures and can be quite intense at this time (Kagan, Kearsley, & Zelazo, 1978).  By this age, children often actively protest their parent\'s leaving.  While such protests can be difficult for parents, they signal how very important parents are to a child\'s security.  After this peak, children become increasingly able to tolerate brief separations. (Clarke-Stewart, 1973; Marvin, 1977).  When parents physically left the laboratory for a few minutes, 12 month olds needed more reassurance upon return than did 18 month olds who just needed brief contact with a parent (Sroufe & Waters, 1977).  It\'s important to remember that children were in a laboratory environment which was unfamiliar to them.  Research shows that for toddlers, when parents explain to children that they are leaving or increase their readiness for separation by interacting with them more, children are less distressed (Lollis, 1990 as cited in Sroufe, Cooper, & DeHart, 1992).

For instance, Judy Dunn, who carried out the research gives the example of a child who has twice been forbidden in the previous 20 minutes to go near and electrical socket, approaching the socket and turning to look at a parent or observer while smiling.  Children have clearly developed a set of expectations for how adults react when they do something forbidden.  According to Dunn (1988), each of the 18 month olds in her study behaved this way.  She described the behavior as unemotional, but instead a checking of what the result of the action will be.  It almost appears to be a teasing. They did not express guilt or shame at all.

By 18-24 months of age, most children show signs of self-recognition when looking in a mirror (though it can be as early as 15 months).  Researchers have discovered that if they put a spot of rouge on a babies nose (Amsterdam, 1972), at 9-12 months, none of the children react to it, by 15 to 18 months, about 25 % of the children react, and by 21 to 24 months 75 % of the children react (Lewis & Brooks, 1978).  The number of children who recognized themselves was slightly higher in more recent research (Asendorpf, Warkentin, & Baudonniere, 1996) which did not assume that all children would be motivated to clean the rouge off their noses.  By the end of the second year, they recognize that others are independent agents (Sroufe, Cooper, & DeHart, 1991).  This makes new social games possible, such as hide-n-seek or chase games.  Contrast this to a game 12 month olds sometimes play where they cover their faces and then peek out in a form of peek-a-boo (Wolf, 1982).  Towards the end of the second year, children actively communicate their wants and needs to others by gesturing and other body language as well as using words.   Children tend to become aware of their intentions and the distinctiveness of their behaviors during toddlerhood.  They often want to do things for themselves and will let others know.  \n\nUnderstanding the self is also about understanding the concept of others and many researchers have argued that the two are linked in development.  The research of Dennie Wolf (1984) suggests a couple of stages that children progress through in understanding the differentiation between self and others.

Research by Robert Selman (1980) shows that around 5 years of age, children draw upon their physical attributes and behavior to explain what their self is. For instance, children might describe themselves as having yellow hair or as being a good boy.  By around age 8, children\'s theories reflect an intentional self--one that has feelings, thoughts, and motives that drive their behavior and might describe themselves this way.  For instance, \"I\'m nice to other people\" or \"I help other kids with their homework.\"  Around 8 or 9, children are said to have a sense of self that includes an inner, private self.  By around age 10, children\'s notion of the self becomes more introspective and they take psychological factors into account, such as moods and feelings.  As children get older, their descriptions include who they are in a social context as well. \n',NULL,NULL,'Maddie is sitting on her mother Julia’s lap.

Research shows that empathetic responses and caring behaviors towards others increase in frequency at around 18 months of age (Zahn-Waxler & Radke-Yarrow, 1984).  Before this, children may have reacted in distress when another child was upset [See Social LW#1, 10-11 Months], however it appears that this response may have more to do with the child becoming upset his or herself at seeing someone else upset.  Now, children are more likely to try to calm the upset child by touching, patting, or doing something to amuse them.  This is not to imply that these behaviors are yet common.  According to Nancy Eisenberg (1992), they increase in frequency but still are relatively rare and between 18 and 36 months of age, children often ignore or watch another\'s distress.  Carollee Howes and JoAnn Farver studied 16-33 month old children\'s spontaneous reactions to a playmates\' distress in a daycare setting.  They found that children responded 22% of the time (Howes & Farver, 1987).  This is lower than what has been found in sibling contexts and the researchers suggest that it may have to do with the numbers of other children and presence of a teacher who also are available to respond.  They found that 93% of all responses were prosocial in nature.  While there were some instances of teasing a crying playmate, unlike four year olds studied by Feshbach and colleagues (as cited in Howes & Farver, 1987), they did not find children chastising other children about crying.  The researchers suggest that children may not view crying with embarrassment or shame yet.  Children were three times more likely to respond prosocially when the child in distress was a friend.  Research by Judy Dunn suggests that when children are responsible for the distress they may exacerbate the situation instead of helping (1988).  Zahn-Waxler and Radke-Yarrow note this to be especially the case for two year olds (1982).

This is an increased empathetic reaction to others.  If this does not work, children may bring some comforting object to the upset person (such as a stuffed animal or blanket).  These types of empathetic behaviors indicate that the child recognizes the distress of another and tries to ease the discomfort.','At about eighteen months #first# will be able to show some early signs of taking another persons perspective, depending on the event, and on the context.  #first# may now exhibit more signs of empathy towards others.

Researchers differentiate between social play and social pretend play.  Social play emerges earlier and does not involve elements of pretense (Howes, 1985).   For children to notice others and interact with them in play is not entirely new at the onset of social play.  Children have been playing interactive games with adults since the first year of life--such as peekaboo or hiding and finding.  They have been noticing other children for quite a while now as well.  Even very young babies tend to notice and get excited by other babies.  However around 14-16 months, children\'s play begins to take on a more interactive character--children take turns responding, imitating each other, and so forth (Singer & Singer, 1990).  While most play is still solitary (investigating objects, etc.) or parallel in nature (playing near another child perhaps with similar toys or a similar game, but not with them), some of this early play has shown initial signs of interaction such as imitative responses to playmates and turn-taking (Brownell, 1990; Eckerman & Stein, 1990).  So, for instance, one child might set up a block and knock it over and then the other child might imitate the action.  Children\'s actions become increasingly complementary and interactive.  For instance, children might engage in running and chasing each other, copying different motions, testing out whether they can do the same kinds of things as each other, hiding and finding each other, tossing toys around and in the case of boys, engaging in a rough and tumble play (Garvey, 1990).    \n\nChildren\'s pretend play also continues to grow at this time, but this pretend play is often solitary.  Solitary pretend play tends to peak at about three years of age (Scarr, Weinberg, & Levine, 1986).  In fact, even though social play is emerging, much of children\'s play continues to be solitary.  For instance, a child may pretend to bathe a doll, to move sand in a dump truck, or to work by using a play hammer to bang in plastic nails.  Sometimes, children pretend around each other, but the pretend is usually about different themes.  Around 25-36 months, children begin to engage in early social pretend play around shared themes (Singer & Singer, 1990).  These early themes are usually about familiar activities children have witnessed, one child might play the mommy and the other, the daddy.  Research by Jacqueline Sachs and colleagues (Sachs, Goldman, & Chaille, 1985) shows that it can still be a challenge for two year olds to play around a theme--that they disagree frequently.  By three, children are able to stick to a theme for a brief period.  As children get a little older, the length and sophistication of play around themes grows. \n','Ted Shadows Simon:','Early Interactive Play                      ','Ted and Simon are taking turns jumping from a low platform onto a soft cushion.  Ted makes a \"bulabulabooo\" sound just before he jumps into the foam.  Simon laughs at Ted\'s antics.  Ted walks over to Simon and makes his \"bulabulabooo\" noise again, as if to deliberately engage Simon.  Simon smiles, runs a few steps away, and throws himself down on the carpet.  Ted follows and imitates Simon by falling on the carpet too.  Both boys continue playing this way for a while, with Simon throwing himself on the carpet and Ted shadowing Simon\'s actions.  Now Simon varies the game by turning a somersault; Ted watches, tries to do the same but blends his move into a roll on his side.  They continue playing this game for two more rounds.','Ted noticed that Simon laughed at the funny noise he had made.  Ted was able to \"read\" Simon\'s laugh as a reaction to his \"bulabulabooo\" noise.  This \"reading\" of another child\'s laugh represents the dawn of social dialogue.  Ted could have noticed Simon\'s laugh but not made the relation to his own behavior.  But we can see from Ted\'s deliberate try to elicit a second laugh from Simon that Ted is sensing his role as an agent of Simon\'s action.  Then Ted shifts to shadowing Simon\'s actions.  While Ted is following Simon and has to accommodate to what Simon does, Simon is also following, careful not to run so far that Ted can\'t keep up.  Simon is not trying to avoid Ted; he is trying to elicit Ted\'s following.  This is a subtle balance of intentions.  In this early form of interactive, social play, both children accommodate each other: it\'s not that one boy consistently shadows the other, but rather that they switch roles.  Of course, Simon\'s somersault was a bit more than Ted could do.  But we should not expect Simon to be able to judge Ted\'s level of skill.  Such a judgment requires social awareness that exceeds this age level.','\nYou may notice other incidents where #first# will imitate as a means to communicate with someone else.\n\n• #first# paces the floor with #his/her# hands behind #his/her# back the same way #his/her# father does.\n• #first# echoes the tonal sounds of a sentence that #his/her# mother just made as in implied request to have her speak to #him/her # again.  \n• #first# throws #his/her# head way back to laugh in the same manner that Aunt Mattie is doing at the moment.  Then #first# pauses to see if Aunt Mattie will respond to the imitation.  \n\nThis section may or may not be used depending on the new look of the site.\nParent as Partner\n\nIt helps children to have some playmates who are at a similar activity level and temperament.  Ted and Simon both like to run, fall, and tumble.  They also are familiar with each other\'s style of play, so they know that this follow-the-leader game is likely to be fun.  Don\'t be too concerned if one child is usually the one who follows.  It takes a great deal of social intelligence and sensitivity to shadow another child.  In the above example, both children are accommodating each other.  Simon has to pause, wait and sometimes mark a new round so that Ted will continue the social play.  In most follow-the-leader games, the leader has to do a little following, too. \n',NULL,'A Mirror to See Us Both','Helping children orient to each other in collaborative play','Social play, at a minimum, requires at least two children who are calmly aware of each other as they are engaged in some activity.  Certain props are well know for their ability to elicit social play, such as a sand table, building blocks, or a box of old dress up clothes.   Slides, see saws, and merry go rounds elicit physical play but do not orient children to each other so well and therefore do not generate conversation and mutual regard the way the other props do.','Set out items that you think will create some need for two children to become aware of each other.  Such items include, long pieces of rope, objects that are moveable but required the combined efforts of two children, tubes that can be joined like fishing pole segments, cushions and play spaces that orient the children inward and toward each other, double telephone toys on a single line, large shoe box size blocks for collaborative constructions, and so forth.  Place some such objects in the room and then wait to notice whether play with these objects foster solitary play or interactive and social play.  ','Sometimes setting up a small table in front of a large mirror will encourage children to think of themselves as a social unit when they see themselves in the mirror working at the table.  The mirror helps the children see themselves as unit of two, as opposed to only thinking about their relation to the work.  Your causal comment can also orient them to each other, such as, \"Ah, you both are ......\"','You will find that the items that provoke social play will change in kind as your child matures.  At first it will the physical objects themselves that structure the social encounter: the way the fishing pole sections suggest a role for two children working together, or the way filling a large container suggests cooperative roles, one holds the container and the other fills it with sand or water.   Later social play will be supported more by interest in common themes: \"Let\'s play life guard; you drown first.\"  Social play can be supported by listening carefully to the children\'s interest and then providing supporting props as soon as possible.  ','It is clear that we all value pro-social behavior in our children.  While we have said nothing about pro-social versus anti-social behavior, we can state at this point that Parent Partners believes children should be initiated into a culture of pro-social behavior.   First find ways that the physical environment can give child a reason to collaborate on tasks that are slightly more difficult than their most recent achievement.  Then make an occasionally comment in a descriptive tone about the details of their pro-social behavior and their willingness to cooperate with a peer.','Dancing Sheet to Sheet','Helping children orient to each other in collaborative play','Certain objects, in a very natural way, give children an opportunity to play interactively, one child doing something to which the other child responds. A bed sheet is one such item, a remnant, say five feet square, not so large that the children step and stumble on it as they play.  Begin by inviting #first# and a friend to stretch the sheet out, like a fire fighter\'s net.  Bellow it up and down with broad movements of your arms.  Encourage the children to do this on their own.  Look for an opportunity to step aside.  Let the children treat the sheet as an event that can be varied.  Let them \"dance\" through broad movements with they bodies. ','As #first# and #his/her# friend vary the movements you can describe both the means (\"You moved your arms down quickly\") and the effects (\"You made the sheet into a roof\").  See if any of your words will give #first# an idea for what to do next, such as by saying \"roof\" #first# might want to run under the sheet when it bellows up.  ','If the two children can not coordinate their movements (which may well be the case) change the game to something else that uses the sheet as a medium for interaction.  It could be that the children would like to hide under the sheet together, away from the busy world.  It could be that the children will want to wrap themselves up in the sheet and walk in a common \"garment.\"  Or two children may want to sit and tug on opposite ends of the sheet in a playful see-saw fashion.  With some guidance from you the sheet can be a medium for building a social relation, a reason for #first# and #his/her# friend to be more aware of each other\'s movements and intentions.','Continue to use the sheet in as many contexts as possible that foster interactive play.  Use it as a shadow screen by stretching it tight and casting a light on it.  Use it as a secret hiding place large enough for two children.\nThe fact that it is the same object, always used in collaborative play, means that the sheet will become known as a \"fun for two\" object.\n','Not only is #first# learning to be creative in the multiple uses of a single object, the sheet, but also #he/she# is learning to include the movements and the interest of another child into #his/her# play.

Around 21 months of age, research suggests that children begin to initiate discussions about what is okay and what is not.  These are early steps towards evaluating what it means to be good.  While 14 month olds express increasing interest in broken, dirty, or misplaced objects, by 21 months, children are initiating more of these conversations with parents than vice versa (Dunn, 1988).  Children also show that they are learning to understand some things about acceptable behavior.  Children are learning that as independent selves or \"agents,\" they are responsible for their actions (Wolf, 1982).  In her naturalistic study of children\'s behavior, Dunn (1988) noticed that children begin to use the terms \"bad\" and \"good\" to describe behaviors around now.  They are beginning to recognize that certain actions are a breach of what is acceptable and in the coming months, they will learn a lot about accountability--that they are responsible for their actions.  While, younger children demonstrate that they have some understanding of  what is okay or not, it is not uncommon for a 16-20 month old to act evasively when they anticipate that a behavior is not acceptable (Dunn, 1988).  So running off with that bag of pretzels they\'re not supposed to have or hiding behind the couch might be their response to anticipating that they\'re not supposed to do what they\'re doing.  Over the course of the next year, children learn to take greater responsibility for their behaviors and to justify them in a variety of ways.

She also seems to understand that an immediate right might reduce the reprimand for her wrong.

However, it is not plausible that Wanda  understood the cleverness of her idea to wash her hands.

This increase is scaffolded and paralleled by the behavior of mothers who justified their own behaviors about 33%, 51%, and 55% of the time , when children were 18, 24, and 36 mos. old, respectively.

They are beginning to figure out that rules are differentially applied depending upon the circumstances (Dunn, 1988).  This can be seen in the excuses that children create for their behaviors.  According to Dunn\'s research (1988), In the coming year, children begin to use excuses for their behavior.  Parents may hear excuses having to do with lack of control such as \"I\'m too little, \"I\'m too tired,\" or \"I can\'t, I\'m too little.\"   Some time in the third year, parents will begin to hear excuses of intent such as, \"I didn\'t mean to,\" \"I\'m not trying to,\" or \"was an accident.\" [See Related Social- 36 Months- Reasoning About One\'s Own Intentions.]  Three year olds  begin to create excuses having to do with pretense such as \"I was just pretending,\" \"It was make-believe,\" \"just playing, okay?\"  \n','Trudy Too-Tired','Trudy discovers the art of making excuses','Trudy was comfortably nestled in the three throw pillows that fill in the corner of the play room.

While  younger children tend to show their empathy through comforting or attempting to make each other laugh, language creates new ways for them to communicate and to get access to emotions. Children\'s first words referring to emotions and feeling states are usually acquired around 18-20 months (Bretherton, McNew, & Beeghly, 1981; Dunn, Bretherton, & Munn,  1987).  Around 24 months, children\'s statements are becoming increasingly differentiated and they grow in frequency (Bretherton et al., 1981; Dunn et al., 1987).  By the time children are 28 months old, many are able to talk about their own and others\' feeling states and can discuss both the causes  and consequences of these experiences (Dunn et al., 1987).  Using language to talk about feelings, helps children to access emotions that are more remote (Izard & Maltesta, 1987 as cited in Woodhead et al., 1995).  This might include past feeling or anticipated feelings as well as helping them find out about others\' feelings.  Dunn, Bretherton, and Munn (1987) studied the naturally occurring conversations that children had at home.  These were families that had either a younger or older sibling which helped to create more opportunities to talk about feelings.  They found that 24 month olds did participate in conversations about the causes of feelings and could think about prior things that happened which contributed to certain kinds of feelings.  Children also engaged in pretend around feelings.  These were games in which youngsters pretended to be sad or tired, for examples.  The most common feeling states that children spoke about were \"sleep/fatigue, distress, pain, pleasure, temperature, and dislike\" (Dunn et al., 1987, p. 138).  Children did not talk about fear and anger as much but researchers suggest that this may be due to the circumstances of the study (conducted at home during daily activities).  Naturalistic research carried out by Judy Dunn (1988) suggests that around two years of age, children are just beginning to ask questions about inner states.  These questions increase markedly over the next twelve months as children\'s questions shift from what the can easily observe towards things that they can\'t observe (inner states and rules).  Research suggests that how parents interact with children around feeling states creates clear differences in how  and to what extent children communicate about feelings (Dunn et al., 1987).  [See the Related Social Parent Mediation LW for an in-depth discussion.]\n\nThe kinds of emotions that children witness are often re-enacted in their own behaviors. Pre-twos and two year olds showed increased upset and aggression after witnessing adult angry quarrels (Zahn-Waxler & Radke-Yarrow, 1982).  Research (Farver & Frosch, 1996) shows that four year olds exposed to the L. A. riots in 1992 told stories with more aggressive themes, words, and characters than did children who were not so exposed.  \n','Tell\'em How You Feel','Natalie Arouses Sympathy First','Natalie just had her older brother Jason snatch the red crayon that she was using to make marks on a large scroll of paper.  The paper now stared at her with a palpable incompleteness.  She had learned that, without her parent\'s help, she probably could not get the crayon back right away.  She bided her time and watched her brother use the crayon.  He was making an entire house red and had miles to go before he breached.  Natalie put her head down with a pained expression.  About that time her mother walks in, and upon seeing Natalie\'s uncharacteristic passiveness, asks her \"Are you feeling o.k.\",  thinking that Natalie might be ill.  \"No! I\'m mad!\" Natalie replies.   Her mother startles and gets a sense for the scene that must have happened, given Jason\'s gusto in contrast to Natalie.  \"Why, sweetie?\"  Natalie sees her salvation before her and says, \"Jason took my red. \"  ','The noticeable feature of this story occurs when Natalie describes her feelings first, rather than diving into a recount of the offending action.  Granted, Natalie\'s mother asked \"Are you feeling o.k.?\" but Natalie could have said, \"He took my red!\" as her first reply.  We can credit Natalie with knowing what constitutes a direct answer to a question about feelings as opposed to an indirect answer about what caused her to feel that way.  We might credit her with an even greater social knowledge.  Perhaps she knows that if she tells her mother about being mad, then her mother will be drawn into the goal of making Natalie feel better.  Simply saying \"He took my red\" does not muster the sympathy that comes from laying out her feelings.   We need not attribute a high level of consciousness to this ploy, but we could support the idea that Natalie understands this dynamic at the practical level.

By 24 months of age, children have a clear understanding that \"self\" and \"other\" are separate entities (Watson & Fischer, 1977).  Young children are learning that they are agents in the world.  This involves making their likes and dislikes known, testing limits, learning about choices, and finding out how they can affect the world around them.  Researcher Charles Wenar (1976) refers to this as executive competence, for instance, an infant who accidentally kicked a mobile, watched it move, and then repeated the action to make it happen again and again.  Asserting oneself by testing limits, voicing definite preferences, and saying \"no\" and insisting upon it are your child\'s new way of having an affect on the world and creating a self identity.  This leads to inevitable clashes of wills with parents who may not view getting dressed as a developmental challenge but a mere matter of clothing a toddler so that a trip to the store can be made, bedtime can proceed and so forth.  These refusals are important because they are a means for your child to establish that they are a separate person and have their own sense of autonomy.  \n\nResearcher Judy Dunn has studied children\'s growth of social understanding.  Her research (Dunn, 1988)  helps provide a picture of how children assert themselves at different ages.  She and others have found that assertive refusals, resisting parents\' demands, and doing exactly what one was just asked not to do are behaviors that double in frequency between 18 and 24 months.  Early forms of resistance involve running off when told to do something in an attempt to evade the situation, engaging in forbidden behaviors anyway while watching for the parents\' reaction, or deliberate attempts to mislead a parent by suggesting that something is true that isn\'t true.  For instance, a child might indicate that they\'re hungry if they want a forbidden cookie or cake.  Around age two, children begin to provide justification for their actions or nonactions depending upon the situation.  So when asked to put their toys away or to stop running inside, they may respond with \"I can\'t\" or \"I\'m too little.\"  [See Related Social LW- 24 Months- Making Excuses for Behavior.]  By around two and a half, children begin to question why they have to do things and by around two and a half to three may do so by questioning applications of rules.  [See Related Social LW- 30 Months- Direct Questioning of Rules.]  For instance, a child might resist going to bed by asking \"why you not go to bed?\"  They will note exceptions to rules, so if they\'ve just been told that they cannot have a cookie before dinner and then Daddy eats one, it will become an issue for discussion.  While these can certainly be trying times for parents, understanding that they are an important part of the child\'s developing sense of self and that they won\'t last forever can help parents put their child\'s behavior into perspective.  \n','Abram Says \"No Footie Pajamas!\": ','Asserting a Sense of Self    ','For the last six months or so, Abram has worn footie pajamas.  But now he refuses to wear them.  His mother gets them out of his drawer one night, and as she brings them over to Abram, he says, \"no, the other ones, no footies.\"   Unfortunately, the other pajamas are in the wash, so his mother tries to persuade him.  \"Oh, here, Abram, these have rubber feet.  They\'ll help you walk and keep your feet warm.\"  Abram insists, \"No, no footies!\"  His mother is curious about his newly expressed dislike for the pajamas: \"Why not?  Why don\'t you want to wear your footie pajamas?  They\'re just perfect.\"  Abram folds his arms tightly, in a gesture of resistance.  \"No, I don\'t want.\" ','Abram is not only showing that he can say no; he is also showing that there is something about these footie pajamas that he dislikes.  It could be something arbitrary, such as their color, or it could be more significant; perhaps the enclosed foot pads make his feet too warm.  Even though he doesn\'t yet have the ability to articulate his reasons -- this will come, in time -- he certainly is making his feelings clear.  ','#first# needs to practice making choices in order to develop into a responsible child.  Here are some places to provide the chance.\n\n• Lay out two colorful t-shirts in the morning and let #first# choose the one #he/she# wants.\n• Show #first# two or three choices for a mid afternoon snack and let #him/her# decide with one #he/she# would like to eat.\n• At clean up time just before the evening meal give #first# a choice between putting away #his/her# clothes first or #his/her# toys first.\n','Children need to feel that they have some choices.  Therefore, parents will want to allow appropriate choices whenever possible and be firm in those instances when a choice is not appropriate, such as when health and safety are at stake.  In the case of Abram, there is no need to insist he wear the footie pajamas.  Abram\'s mother might let him wear soft day clothes to bed this once.  Or, she might even suggest that together they cut the feet off of Abram\'s footie pajamas.  This way, she might garner some extra months of use from the pajamas, while at the same time affirming Abram\'s rights to his own preferences.  You may find some of your child\'s developing preferences inconvenient, and even inexplicable.  Accommodating children\'s preferences, even when they cannot explain their reasons, helps them to feel a sense of control over their world.  Encouraging  children to talk more about their preferences, gradually and in a completely non-confrontational manner, keeps communication flowing.','Are You My Mother?   ','A story of self assertiveness and confusion\n\n','You may be familiar with the children\'s book, Are You My Mother?, by P.D. Eastman (Random House, 1960).  It is a cleverly illustrated story about a bird who hatches while his mother is out getting food.  The new hatchling steps out of his shell, wonders where his mother is, and sets out on his own to find her.  He asks everyone (really, everything) from a cat to an airplane, \"Are you my mother?\" until finally a steam shovel scoops him up and deposits him back in his nest just as his mother returns.  Mother bird and baby bird hug, and then he reviews his lesson: \"You are not a kitten, not an airplane, not a steam shovel ...  you are a bird and you are my mother.\"','Read this story to #first#.  ##he/she## probably will want you to read it many times.  Ask #him/her# to say the final refrain with you: \"not a kitten, not an airplane ...\" as you point to the words and pictures in the book.  You might both enjoy saying the resolution together: \"you are a bird and you are my mother.\"  Then tell #him/her# a few other things that you are not: not a chair, not a cat, not a hat -- you are a person and you are #his/her# mother.[**or her father]  Perhaps #first# will make some suggestions of #his/her# own about what you are not, but #he/she# may not be ready for this reverse logic until some months from now.','Watch #first# carefully as you read.  Does #he/she# want to go back to any particular page or to wait a few moments longer before turning a page?  Use these cues as markers for what #first# thinks about the story.  Does #he/she# sense that the little bird gets more and more confused as the story goes on?  Does #he/she# wonder why the mother is not there?  If you sense that #first# is interested in a particular aspect of the story, try to put #first#\'s feelings in words in the form of a yes/no question: \"The steam shovel frightens you?\"','One fun aspect of this story is the way it plays on what something is not, as well as what something is.  Does #first# think some of the things that the mother is not are funnier than other things?  For example, is it funnier being a not-kitten than being a not-plane?  As #first# develops, ask #him/her# to think of other things that the mother bird is not.  Does #first# relate to the little bird\'s impatience at not finding his mother when he steps out of his eggshell?  Does #first# think that #he/she# would have left the nest to search for #his/her# mother, or would #he/she# have waited in the nest for #his/her# mother to return?  We\'d like to know how #first# reacts to this story.  If you have a chance to read it to #him/her#, please let Parent Partners know what #he/she# says.',' Any story you choose to read to your child will be a pleasurable and rich learning experience for her.  Your reading will help your child make the connection between those funny marks on the page and the words that you say.  This particular story shows the disadvantage and advantages of self-assertiveness.  The little bird got lost from his mother but, when he found her, he knew more about who she was not.  The story also presents an interesting use of negation, that is, listing the negative rather than the positive characteristics of something.  This helps your child learn to experiment with logic.  Knowing what something is not helps to define what it is.','No More Monkeys Jumping on the Bed.','A rhyme about rules','Children like to assert themselves and even to practice their authority in pretend play and in rhymes.  The following is a favorite rhyme that you may already know.  It will be fun for #first# because it give licensee to his authority to scold a bunch of silly monkeys.','Say this rhyme and in time your child will say it with you.

Be content if he smiles at the rhyme and just does the gesture part.  Repetition has a way of soothing children.  The predictability gives them comfort.','Ask #first# if #he/she# wants to substitute some other animal.  ##he/she## might want to say the rhyme with \"Five little kangaroos jumping on the bed.\"  ##he/she## might want to change what they are jumping on, such as \"jumping on the stove.\"   But be prepared for that frequently hear phrase, \"You can\'t do that.\" when you suggest a change.  But you could say you heard the rhyme another way in another place and you just wondered if #he/she# will like it.  Say the changed way to see how #first# reacts.','Your child probably will love the part where the doctors shakes his finger and says, \"No more monkeys jumping in the bed.\"  Your child will adopt the sense of authority which these lines imply.  The rhyme gives your child a positive way to let you know he can lay down the law, indeed, that he knows the law.  Of course, the rhyme has the added benefit of using a counting game to create a sense of climax when there are no more monkeys.

Research shows that depending upon the kinds of responsibilities that grandmothers report taking on in relation to the children, 1 and 2 year olds treat their maternal grandmothers differently than strangers and in some cases, interchangeably with their mothers in studies of their attachment (Myers, Jarvis, & Creasey, 19xx; Tomlin & Passman, 1989).  As children mature, they may have special routines and games that they associate with certain people.  These games become especially important if children don\'t see grandparents often as they become a script for interacting and becoming familiar after an absence.  Children\'s relationships with their grandparents grow and change over time.  First and second graders described their relationships to their grandparents as one in which they received nurturance and affection whereas fourth and fifth graders were more likely to refer to guidance and pride in family history as the things that they got out of the relationship (Ponzetti & Folkrod, 1989).   ','Gawma\'s Game','Charley\'s Relationships with Special Others','It is always a special event when Charley sees his grandmother -- about six or eight times a year.  This time, his \"Gawma\" arrives at the house a few hours before bedtime.  Charley is very excited to see her, even though he had not shown much anticipation before hand.  At bedtime, Charley grabs Grandma\'s hand and pulls her to his bedside, saying, \"Do roll-you-up.\"  Grandma then plays a special game that they often play.  She kneads Charley like pasty dough, saying, \"I\'m gonna roll you up, put you in the oven, bake you to a sweet bun and then eat you up,\" as she kisses him loudly several times on his neck and cheek.  Charley squeals with delight and is content now that they have played their special game.','Charley is old enough to expect that playing with his grandmother will be different from playing with his mother.  There are Gawma games and there are mother games.  Charley even knows how to initiate the game at the usual time of day.  While the \"roll you up\" game is not part of his daily routine, it is part of Charley\'s routine with his grandmother.  Thus, his grandmother\'s presence elicits the routine.  It is also interesting that Charley is content with only one \"roll you up\" game.  This suggests that the game is more than an exciting sensory experience, it is a way to confirm that this is really his \"Gawma.\"  Notice that Charley says \"Do roll you up\" instead of \"Do roll me up,\" imitating the sentence he hears his grandmother say.','Special routines often serve as a way to re-familiarize a setting or person when #first# needs to adjust\n\n• #first# asks Grandpa to whistle, but mostly on the first day of his visit.\n• #first# always goes first thing to the rocking horse when visiting at Aunt Eunice\'s house.\n• At bed time #first# always wants you to hug #him/her# just so before you leave the room.\n','Charley\'s mother understands that developing special relations with other adults and children will help Charley discover new aspects of himself.  #First# may assume a different attitude when in the presence of a special person; this can be a good sign of healthy development.  Relationships with special people, such as grandparents, give children the opportunity to learn certain things from someone other than you.  Sometimes being a Parent Partner requires you to extend your partnership to others.  ','Mundane Games of Greeting','Revisiting the special games that a relative plays with your child.','The next time #first#\'s grandparent or other close relative is about to come over, think about the special games and little rituals that the relative usually uses to greet #first# when #he/she# arrives.  For example, the relative may always lift #first# up in the air, or giver #him/her# a little gift, or perhaps ask a familiar question, such as, \"And how\'s my little pumpkin?\"  Now, try to remember how #first# responds to these little games.  If #first# initiates the game, think about the response of the family member.','Let\'s say that it is your own father who comes in the door and he says to #first#, \"There you are, I\'m gonna get you.  I\'m gonna get you!\" and tickles #first# until #he/she# laughs.  Now give the ritual a name out loud.  \"Ah, the ole\' Tickle Tickle Game.\"  Use words that you think will be easy for #first# to pronounce.  In spite of the boisterous fun, make sure that #first# hears what you have named the game.','If the relation between your child and the family member does not have any clearly defined arrival rituals, then look for other special forms of behavior that are associated only with this person.  It could be that #first# loves to pull on Grandaddy\'s ears, or loves to sit in his ample lap, or usually reaches in Grandaddy\'s coat pocket (perhaps because #his/her# father seldom wears coats).  Something will define an interaction with Granddaddy that is special and different than interactions with Daddy and certainly different than interactions with strangers.  When this behavior occurs, say in a neutral tone, \"You love to ... (reach in Grandaddy\'s pocket).\"  Be careful to not say, \"... don\'t you?\" at the end.  This phrase implies that you are waiting for an answer, which could make #first# think you do not approve of the special behavior with Granddaddy.','The day after Granddaddy leaves, remind #first# about the special game or behavior: \"Granddaddy really likes you, and he loves to play the Tickle Tickle game.\"  That may be enough.  #first# may want to add to this little recollection too; #he/she# may add, \"Boy, yes\" as #he/she# laughs at the memory.  If #first# is in a more talkative mood, you could ask what else #he/she# remembers about Grandaddy\'s special ways.  You\'re helping #first# focus not just on Grandaddy\'s visit (e.g., \"What did you and Granddaddy do yesterday?\") but on the special games that #first# and play together, the behavior that defines and bonds their relationship.  See if these rituals grow in complexity or fade away over time.  If they fade away, does some new form replace the old?  Are the new forms more perfunctory and off-handed or do they capture a new energy?  Does #first# anticipate the game and begin to initiate the game on subsequent visits or at least position #himself/herself# near to signal that #he/she# is ready to play?','So often we remember the special events we share with people we love, like a trip to the pond or an amusement park.  But it is the mundane and somewhat ritualized interactions with loved ones that define the bond, the special relation.

','Grandparent Games in Review','Using family photos to revisit special moments with relatives','\nWe all take photographs when our relatives come, especially when they come for special holidays.  Yet on so many of these occasions the photographs are full face smiles rather than candid shots of action.

For example,  grandmother might like to read to #first# or granddaddy might like to show #first# his pocket watch.  An uncle might do impressions, or do a little dance step, or do a slight of hand trick on more than one occasion.

Children\'s pretend play continues to develop as they grow in their understanding of representation but this early pretend play is often solitary prior to around 25 months.  For instance, children might play that they are giving their doll a bath and putting it to bed as they have seen their mother tend to them (an example of deferred imitation which is still common at this age).  Sometimes, younger children may play pretend games around others, but these are not around a shared theme or younger children might engage in social play, but it is not pretend play.  Around now, children begin to orient their pretend play around a shared story.  This early social pretend play is often a kind of socio-dramatic play--where children act out dialogues based upon events that they have observed in their social environment (Garvey, 1990).   Sociodramatic play is different from thematic fantasy play (Smilansky, 1968).  Sociodramatic play routines or scripts are usually enacted in the same way each time (as compared to fantasy play which is more flexible and creative.)  What happens in the sociodramatic pretending is defined by scripts that children have observed and reflects the child\'s growing knowledge about routine events in the world as well as growing ability to communicate with others (Sachs, Goldman, & Chaille, 1985).  This means that they may use prototypical roles such as mommies and daddies and may enact particular events that they have seen.  In fact, children often derive prototypical ways of acting out each role that might concern the most gender-equity conscious parents.  These prototypical \"rules\" can be witnessed through children\'s insistence about what mommies, daddies, and babies are supposed to do.  A number of researchers have pointed out that these \"rules\" are often stereotyped to the extent that they don\'t resemble reality, for instance babies that say goo-goo or daddies who carry briefcases whether or not Daddy actually does (Garvey, 1990; Vygotsky, 1967).  Children tend to follow these scripts fairly rigidly as parents who may have played with their children and gotten a bit too inventive are quick to discover from their child\'s exasperated \"Daddies aren\'t supposed to do that!\"  By around three and a half, social pretend play becomes more extensive, flexible, and involves more fantasy play as children begin to negotiate the blueprints for their actions and the nature of the roles for the characters.

These scripts are prototypical versions of what Melissa and Kendra may have seen in their experience at one time or another.  It does not mean, however, that they have witnessed these exact scenes.  In fact, children often reduce roles to their most basic elements and may also embellish them in certain ways.  For example, kids may be more harsh that any parent would typically be.  The chances are that Kendra has not actually seen a mommy get mad at a baby for not sleeping, but may have sensed a parent\'s frustration at trying to calm a difficult to soothe baby.  This type of play helps children explore and compare their understandings of \"how things are supposed to work.\"  Kendra clearly disagrees with Melissa\'s enactment of the baby role when the baby retaliates against the mother.  The two of them may offer other possibilities for what the baby can and cannot do.  If Melissa finds the baby role to be too powerless, she may decide that she wants to be another mommy or to play the role of the daddy.','Social drammatic play give children a means to experiment with variations in a social script.\n\n• #first# acts out feeding a younger child, but lets the pretend child eat directly from the bowl. \n• #first# pretends to be the daddy but in a very fluid manner also switches  to being the mother sometimes.\n• #first# ends a pretend scene with the baby getting a scolding, but then redoes the scene and has the mother just laugh at the baby\'s mistake.\n','Together, Melissa and Kendra are figuring out how roles and routines work.  They are comparing each other\'s understanding and arriving at a shared definition.  Parents can support social pretend play by arranging opportunities for children to play with other kids who are at the same level so that there is a give and take of ideas.  Parents can also help by providing unstructured time so that children can engage in play that best serves their developmental needs.  While it can be a bit startling, don\'t take offense when you see what could be a caricature of yourself in your child\'s play.  The roles children are abstracting do tend to be stereotypical and while they derive from real life and imitate it to some extent, they are by no means exact copies.  If #first# engages you in social scripted play of this sort, you may want to think about what your role should be through #his/her# eyes and if you engage in behaviors that #he/she# considers inappropriate, don\'t be surprised when you are admonished and expected to act as the character is supposed to act.  Sometimes what the character is supposed to do is by no means rational, for instance, you may be expected to wear a flowered shawl in order to be the mommy or a hat to be the daddy.  ','Toy People Can Relate','Playing the counter role to support scripted play','For hundreds of years children have had replica objects available for symbolic play.  You will discover that #first# will act out social scripts and discuss the degree to which the enactment conforms to #his/her# expectations.  Look for an opportunity to support symbolic play and use it to help #first# define and refine the social scripts.','Observe #first#\'s symbolic play and wait until you have figured out the social script that #he/she# is enacting.  Then take a replica toy and announce that you are ... xx ....(some character that has a special relation to the character #first# is pretending to be).  For example, if #first# is the mommy, make your toy the baby, if #first#\'s toy is the super hero, you be the evil monster. ','As the play continues let #first# give you instructions regarding the roles of the characters.  Add sound effects and voices to add realism and context to the play.  Do not be surprised if you are asked to do things that are only arbitrarily aspects of your role but which #first# believes to be the essence of a role, e.g. \"You\'re daddy; you have to sit in the chair.\"   Remember that #first# is learning and it is important for #him/her# to carry #his/her# ideas to their illogical (yes, illogical) conclusions.',' If #first# accepts you as a player, these encounters will provide many opportunities for defining and refining #first#\'s understanding of social exchanges.  #first# will develop problem solving strategies to compensate for consequences that #he/she# did not expect or did not like.  For example, if you resist a bit when #he/she# commands that you (the baby) go to sleep, #he/she# could re-invent the tactic of soothing the baby instead of yelling at the baby. ','Through symbolic play, you can help #first#  confront the consequences of #his/her# own judgment.  As you play \"in character\" you can structure a scene that presents new perspectives about how something could or should be done.   In essence, symbolic play with replica toys is a scaled down, safer version of real life social exchanges.  ','The Perfect Hat','Supporting the onset of scripted play','Children are natural actors.  Their pretense is both dramatic and informative; drammatic in it\'s everyday realism and informative in it\'s script-like structure.  As we observe their play we realize they are acting out a script which represents their current understanding of some social situation or social role.  We can increase the occurrence of scripted play by providing props like old clothes and household objects.  The drama gains an added energy when your child has friends over to play, friends who can assume some of the other roles.','These little social drama are nurtured by the absence of adults because they are often about adults.  Of course you can be near by, half reading the newspaper, half attending to the play.  Your primary support will be in listening and figuring out what props, spaces, times of day can be modified to support your child.  Say you overhear a pretense about eating good food, that some food is junk and other food is healthy.  This might prompt you to lay out, for the next day, empty cereal boxes (the small ones) and empty cookie boxes.  These props could provide a better scaffold for future play.  Or you might overhear a pretense about wearing a rain hat to protect yourself from getting a cold, or washing your hands before a meal, or being quite in the library.   Think about how these themes can be supported and expanded through appropriate props.','If the props alone do not stimulate scripted play, then lay out a few photographs of a trip to a restaurant or even a cartoon sequence about a child following a routine script of some sort, like putting on a rain hat before going outdoors.  Try to find photographs that have some personal meaning for #first#, or at least, a sequence of images that are familiar to #him/her#.  You can open a picture book to an appropriate scene and clamp the pages open to that scene using a metal clamp.  These images can provoke #first# to enact the scene and play out the social roles and scripts implied in the scene.  Do not tell #first# to act out the scene in the photograph or illustration.  Just lay the images in the play space.  Remember, this type of play, above all others, is highly personal and must emerge from the interests and emotions that #first# feels inside.','As #first# becomes more assertive in inventing scripted play and as #he/she# realizes your gentle forms of supporting the quality of #his/her# play, #he/she# may invite you into her world and ask you to play one of the roles.  Consider this a magical moment and honor #his/her# trust with your full attention to #his/her# requests.  Do not try to lead the play, but your can certainly be consistent with what you think your assigned role is.  For example, if #first# asks you to wash your hands before a pretend meal, you can both wash and dry your hands.  Since #first# may not have thought about drying the hands, you have, without intrusion, added richness to the quality of the scripted play. ','Anytime #first# creates a representation of a concept, such as a pretend play sequence about a social role such as \"mother\" or \"teacher\", #he/she# has an opportunity to re-construct #his/her# understanding.  By representing knowledge #first# de-bugs and improves knowledge through remembering, reflecting, comparing, generalizing, and just by trying to make sense of how things happen.  The play is not the real event and has no ill consequences if some script is not quite right.  Thus #first# can experiment better in play than in real life situations, and it is through experimentation, adding elements, leaving out elements, that #first# learns.  This may sound odd, because so often we think children have to learn in the real world, the world of \"hard knocks.\"  But we now feel that learning in the real world only conditions a child to avoid the knocks.  Through play and other forms of representation, #first# will come closer to understanding the reasons behind \"good behavior.','2012-08-22 12:30:11','2012-08-22 12:30:11'),(2727,'s_30_2','Direct Questioning of Rules','In the second half of the third year, the frequency of children\'s direct questioning of rules escalates (Dunn, 1988, p. 36.)  According to Judy Dunn, this relates to a growth in children\'s understanding of rules.  Naturalistic research by Dunn and colleagues (1988) shows that children have grown able to justify the existence of rules in terms of safety, equal application to all, and the kinds of consequences that can result if rules are not followed.  Dunn found that direct questioning of rules was often targeted at mothers\' requests for children to do or not do something.  As parents make requests of children that conflict with the child\'s own goals, the child is likely to question the rule and ask for a reason, such as \"Why I not have a cookie?\" or \"Why you not go to bed now, too?\"  At the same time, children are often adept at justifying why a rule cannot apply to them.  Dunn and colleagues found that, for instance, in helping to clean up, children often generated excuses for not helping, such as \"I can\'t,\" \"I\'m too little,\" or \"I\'m tired.\" [See Related Social LW, 24 Months- Making Excuses for Behavior.]  Children also begin to enlist a new set of tactics for why they shouldn\'t have to follow a rule (Dunn, 1988).  According to the research of Judy Dunn, children now begin to bargain with their parents (\"I\'ll be really good if I can stay up\"), use threats (\"I\'ll tell my daddy\" or \"I\'ll be really mad at you\"), or deny future consequences, (\"I won\'t be tired,\" \"I not get sick,\" or \"I not be cold.\")','A Thousand Reasons to Stay Up','Carl Negotiates Bedtime with Flexibility','Carl has a habit of putting off his father\'s request to come to bed.  When he was younger he would simply say, \"No, dunwanna.\"  He now uses more advanced strategies to bargain with his father.  If his father says, \"O.K. Carl, time to go to bed,\" Carl will say, \"Soon, Daddy.\"  On the other hand his father sometimes give Carl a reason, such as:  \"Come to bed Carl. You don\'t want to be tired and cranky in the morning.\"   Carl is quick to reply, \"I won\'t be cranky, not one bit.\"  To further demonstrate Carl\'s savior faire, if his father says, \"Let go see Mr. Sandman,\" as a positive incentive, Carl has been heard to say, \"Saw him last night, Daddy.\"  ','Carl exhibits his understanding of rules in his ability to invent plausible exceptions to these rules.  As trying as his intelligence might be to his parents, one has to grant him skill in the art of negotiations.  Nevertheless\nit is important to remember that these self serving forms of thinking help to develop high levels of social knowledge.  It is also important to find ways to gain compliance to the limits of most rules while at the same time not stifling the amazing cognitive feats of a budding negotiator. \n','Much of #first#\'s social intelligence dealing with rules will indeed occur when #he/she# questions rules that apply to #him/her#.

By three years of age, children demonstrate that they understand some things about each of these.  Children begin to use the terms \"think\" and \"know\" when they are still two years old.  But what does it means to really think and know?  Research shows that around three, children do understand that if one person looks into a box and another person didn\'t, then the person who looked knows what\'s in it while the person who didn\'t look doesn\'t know (Pillow, 1989; Pratt & Bryant, 1990).  According to John Flavell, three year olds have some sense that one has to have a \"cognitive connection\" to the information in order to \"know it.\"(Flavell, 1988.)  This understanding is still fairly fragile and depends upon exactly what is being asked.  For instance, until about age five, children have difficulty telling whether they would have to see or feel something to know about its color or its texture (O\'Neill, Astington, & Flavell, 1992).  (However, if the information were in front of them, they could respond appropriately to showing the blue one or the rough one.)  \n\nWhat about the second aspect of knowing another\'s mind--taking the perspective of someone else?  When three year olds are asked to take the perspective of another or figure out what another person would know based on certain information, they tend to run into difficulties.  For instance, three year olds do not understand that having certain prior knowledge or a particular perspective influences how people understand and interpret events (Ruffman, Olson, & Astington, 1991).  By age four, children have learned more about how to think about others\' minds.  Wimmer and Perner did some interesting research on what they called the \"false-belief paradigm.\"  Children saw a story in which a child puts a marble in a basket and then goes away and another child comes and moves the marble to a box.  When asked where the first child will look for the marble when she returns, it is not until age four that children say that the child will look in the basket where she left the marble while younger children expect her to look in the box (Wimmer, & Perner, 1983).  This suggests that by four, children are more successful at predicting what others know and how their beliefs will influence their actions.  Research studies such as these showing children\'s ability to consider others\' minds and to make such predictions has helped to challenge the notion from earlier Piagetian research suggesting that children are unable to adopt the perspective of others until they are seven or eight.  However, other research helps to illustrate that the ability to do so is developing and fragile.  This means that children may show understanding of others\' minds in some instances but not others.  So while a four year old may be able to predict where people will look for something that they think they lost in a certain place, that same four year old might think that a good present for Mommy\'s birthday is a toy truck that the child has been admiring (Flavell et al., 1968). \n','Tyler\'s Surprise: ','Learning About Others\' Minds','For his third birthday, Tyler\'s parents are building a plates in the backyard.  He tells his aunt who calls him from a distant city.  She asks him what it is like.  \"It\'s right out there,\" he says pointing.  \"But I can\'t see it, Tyler. Can you tell me about it?\"  \"It\'s got that part for Connor and that part for me,\" he responds.','At some level Tyler realizes that he must say something specific about the plates in order for his aunt to share his delight.  He does have an emerging understanding of another person\'s mind.  However, Tyler does not realize that the manner in which he describes a part (\"that part for Connor\") is personal and may not be well referenced for his aunt.  Tyler needs to do a reference check first, something like, \"Remember the thing that Connor likes to go down?\"  Once this point of reference is shared between them, then Tyler could say, \"My plates has that part for Connor.\"  Communication is a continual process of each person checking on his/her understanding of the other person\'s knowledge base. ','There are other occasions where it will be important for #first# to think clearly about what another person does know or could not possibly know.\n\n• #first# is telling a friend about a trip that did not include the friend\n• #first# sees #his/her# dad put mom\'s gloves in a kitchen drawer and  then sees mom exasperated as she looks for them. \n• #first# sees a mouse at #his/her# sister\'s feet while #his/her# sister is reading a book. \n','Learning about other\'s minds is a big step because it involves stepping outside one\'s own point of view.  Not so long ago, experts thought that children were too self-centered -- egocentric -- to do so at such an early age.  Now we know that children do think about other\'s minds in limited ways and that certain experiences can help them learn more about others\' thinking.  Tyler\'s aunt helped him by asking questions about the structure.  \"I can\'t see your backyard cause I\'m at my house but I remember your sandbox.  Is the plates by your sandbox?  Does it have one part or two?  Is it bigger than you?  After asking three to four questions (as many as a three year old would care to answer about something he thinks you ought to be able to know anyway) the aunt responded with \"Now I can guess what it looks like.  When I come to your house, I\'ll get to see it and know all about what it looks like.\"  Look for times when you can make a game of not knowing something that #first# knows.  For instance, when #he/she# gives you a present. You might say, \"I don\'t know what\'s in this box because I haven\'t seen it.  Do you know?  You do know, don\'t you?\"  #first# may just tell you what\'s in the box, but the guessing game can go on.  \"Oh, so now I know because you told me it\'s a sweater.  But I still don\'t know what it looks like.  Don\'t tell me, let me guess.  I wonder what color it is, maybe it\'s blue.\"  Guessing wrong and then being surprised upon opening the box helps #first# to realize that what is in your mind is different from what is in #his/her# mind.     ','Two Reasons to Miss','Studying the intentions of others during a game','Children in this range have developed a new understanding of other people\'s intentions, thoughts, and feelings.  You can help #first# further develop this awareness by playing games that have rules.  For example, when one child bounces a ball to another child, she may bounce it so that the other child can catch it, or she may bounce it so that it\'s a challenge to catch the ball.  These two different intentions frame and define the meaning of missing a catch.  In the first case, the intent is cooperative, so a missed ball is framed as the fault of the child who bounced the ball.  In the second case, which has a more competitive intent, a missed ball is not seen as the first child\'s fault, but rather, as her objective.  ',' Find an opportunity where #first# is playing a game with rules.  Rolling games are fun and can easily shift from cooperative to competitive.  Perhaps a game of skittles would do.  A skittles is a heavy little object with a tiny handle on top and large ball bearing underneath.  Skittles slide across a table like a hockey puck on ice.  You can play a cooperative game where you try to push your skittle into a half cup (cut lengthwise) that #first# controls, or you can reframe it a competitive game where you try to push your skittle into the cup against #first#\'s effort to move the cup to the side.  In the first case a hit is framed as credit to you both; in the second case a hit is framed as credit to the aimer only.','Rolling games involve varying degrees of skill.  #first# may understand the intent of these games but may need a more structured version, such as a marble rolling in a track.  Try the following version if need be.  Set up two marble rollway tracks side by side.  #first# can change the incline and direction of the marble ramp.  In one game, the rule is to knock over little cylinders that you place on the table surface just beyond the foot of the incline.  In the other version, you both try to roll the marble beyond the cluster of cylinders without hitting any.  In the first case, hitting a cylinder is a good; in the second, hitting a cylinder is a bad.  While this simpler version does not deal with competition and cooperation, it is nevertheless a game where #first# must decide between mutually exclusive objectives: knocking down a cylinder or avoiding hitting one.','The rules of cooperation versus competition can develop into versions more complicated than the rolling games mentioned above.  Some games can involve an element of strategy where #first# tries to fool you into thinking #his/her# intention is something other than it is.  For example, #he/she# may look to the right and then make the ball roll to the left.  Or #he/she# may make an exaggerated gesture that precedes a hard bounce and at the last second switch it to a soft bounce.  These strategies indicate that #first# is thinking about your thinking and trying to throw you off.','These games with rules give #first# an opportunity to think about the intentions behind another person\'s action.  This helps #him/her# learn new behavior, such as strategies of play.  And when #first# chooses one version of a game that has mutually exclusive objectives, #he/she# is learning a similar concept of mind.  Cheering for a hit in one case and cheering for a miss in another can only make sense to #first# when #he/she# considers the intention of the bowler.','The Treasure Hunt','Who knows what, a case of thinking about thinking','Find an occasion where you, #first#, and another person have to find something.  Try to set the situation so that #first# sees you looking at an event that the third person does not see.  Say, you and #first# hide Easter eggs together, but your spouse is in the house.  Does #first# know that you know something that your spouse does not know.  A treasure hunt game will work just as well if your don\'t want to look for eggs in April.  ','Arrange this game so that for a few of the hidden objects the third person accidentally watched the hiding and for others he did not see.  Make the hiding places rather hard.  Then as the search begins, the third person will go directly to some and have no idea about the location of others.  After the \"known\" ones are found quickly and the unknown ones are not, bring up the question about why some were easy to find.  Note if your child reasons that \"he peeked\" or  \"those were easy.\"  Try to \"unpack\" the meaning of these words.  \"Easy\" could mean \"obvious hiding place\" or that the searcher had prior information.  ','Simpler versions of this game can be played on a smaller scale, such as at bedtime using the covers as a playing field.  When #first# is under the covers, place something under the covers that belongs to your spouse, such as a brush or book.  Then invite your spouse to come find the hidden object.  Again, notice if #first# can maintain a neutral gaze and understands how your spouse does not know but has to guess.  Encourage your spouse to think out loud, to model how he/she figures where the hidden object might be.','Hiding places can vary in complexity.  Hiding a toy under a pillow is less complex than hiding a toy under the sofa cushion that itself is under a pillow.  #first# might lift the pillow but upon not finding the toy will go elsewhere rather than looking under the sofa cushion.   Think about which hiding places are more difficult and also think about how to vary #first#\'s awareness of what the other person (the searcher) knows.  For example, you could tell the searcher over the telephone or you could let the searcher watch the hiding itself.  Can #first# appreciate that information over the telephone is less explicit than information gathered by watching.','These games will engage #first# to think about what someone else knows.  This process, called meta-cognition, is an important step in #first#\'s development.  Thinking about another person\'s thinking is fundamental to a whole host of social concepts, from empathy to personal effectiveness in leadership.  Thus, rest assured that when you or your spouse model your thinking out loud as you search for objects that you are presenting #first# with very useful meta-cognitive strategies and dispositions.  Let Parent Partners know what #first# says or does when you play these hiding games.

Some of their friendships may last a year or longer (e.g. Howes, 1988).  Recall that by the end of toddlerhood, children are beginning to coordinate their play more and more and are beginning to play more interactively.  Some early research (Banham Bridges, 1933) suggested that as early as fourteen months, toddlers begin to show initial preferences in their playmates.  According to Joseph Jacobson (1977), these preferences appear to stem from similarities in developmental levels, temperaments and styles of behaving--as well as practical issues such as how well their parents get along!  By the preschool period, the early signs of genuine friendship begin to emerge in that children show definite preferences in their play, coordinate their play with certain playmates, begin to spend more and more time with preferred partners, and actually begin to modify their behaviors to maintain and build friendships.  While parents and school groups may help to support children\'s patterns of play with particular youngsters, by four years of age, children are showing that they can engage in behaviors to proactively maintain friendships.  They behave differently towards children they consider to be friends than non-friends.  They tend to be more cooperative with children considered to be friends.  However, they also engage in more disagreements.  The disagreements are less likely to be confrontative or to break down the friendship and are more likely to be worked out (Hartup & Laursen, 1993).   It is as though children are testing out what is fair and how to compromise in the safety of a friendship.  According to Nancy Eisenberg (1992), when children engage in prosocial actions, such as sharing a piece of their playdough or offering to help another child with as task, around age 4 or 5 their justifications begin to include references to friendship as a basis for their actions.\n\nWhether or not children make friends can be quite a source of concern for parents.  What are the skills of friendship and how do children develop them?  Children need to know how to reach out and gain entry into group activities, manage conflict in appropriate ways, express positive behaviors towards others, and be sensitive to the needs of other children.  William Corsaro\'s research (1979) on how children gain access to group activities shows that young children are more likely to use nonverbal than verbal strategies to get involved in a group.  Instead of asking, \"Can I play?\" to which the other child can answer \"No,\" children might enter into the activity by engaging in similar behaviors and then by connecting what he or she is doing to the play that others are engaged in.  The research of John Gottman and colleagues suggests that by the time children are in third or fourth grade, they tend to be more direct and have a fairly extensive repertoire of friend-making skills, including offering greetings, connection-making information (such as, \"I like soccer\"), invitations and requesting information about the potential friend\'s likes and dislikes (Gottman, Gonso, & Rasmussen, 1975).  Whether children can maintain friendships depends partly upon how they include and accept others in their play.  Willard Hartup and his colleagues found that the most popular children tend to pay attention to others, praise and show positive affect to others, and are inclusive, compromising, and accepting of others (Hartup, Glazer, & Charlesworth, 1967).  Research suggests that overly aggressive children and overly submissive children can be taught to modify their behaviors to help them gain and maintain friendships (Stocking, & Arezzo, 1979). \n','Ariel\'s First Friend:','Developing Real Friendships ','Ariel wanders over to the play dough table at the parent cooperative where she goes for day care.

After Zoie has shaped all of her play dough into little balls, she says to the parent in charge, \"I need more.\"  Ariel holds out a piece of blue play dough to Zoie and says, \"Want blue?\"  Zoie takes the play dough from Ariel.  The parent smiles at Ariel and says, \"Zoie is your buddy, isn\'t she?\"','Ariel is showing a definite preference towards Zoie as compared to the other children.  At this age, she indicates this through her choice of seat, the way she accommodates her play to Zoie\'s as a way to enter into the activity, and her sharing of play dough with Zoie.  While Max and Kyle are also at the table, Ariel pays less attention to what they are doing in their play.  Sharing can be hard at this age, but Ariel has lots of play dough and uses it to connect with Zoie.','#first# will demonstrate his preference for a child as a friend and exhibit skill in maintaining that friendship.\n\n• #first# will allow #his/her# special friend to use #his/her# toys.\n• #first# will seek out #his/her# special friend when they are in a group.\n• #first# will show more deference to #his/her# special friend, such as asking this child if a change in the rules of play is o.k.\n• #first# will seek to maintain the length of play with #his/her# special friend by either being more entertaining or offering more concessions.\n','In this instance, the parent helped make explicit what Ariel did and that the action suggested that Ariel was being a friend.  Young children can\'t usually say what makes a good friend or why they are friends with someone.  Parents can help children begin to think about this by drawing attention to specific behaviors and saying something like, \"I see that Zoie needed a piece and Ariel gave her one.  Friends do nice things like that for each other.\"  Parents can support children\'s budding friendships by creating opportunities for the friends to play together and unless things get out of hand, by letting them negotiate their fun and their conflicts.  Early friendships help children learn about compromise, what is fair, and about balancing their needs with someone else\'s.  If Ariel were having difficulty working something out with Zoie, Ariel\'s parent could help her think about what she could do and what kinds of things would help her to be a good and fair friend.','Forming Friendships','Helping #first# know about a budding friendship','#first# is beginning to form special relations with some children.  The next time you are nearby when #first# is among other children, take special note of who #he/she# seeks out and how #he/she# enters play with the other children.  Try to determine if #he/she# has one or two special friends.  In what ways does #first# communicate that the other child is #his/her# friend?','Let\'s say that #first# has come into a room where other children are already at play.  Does #first# approach an adult, a child at random, a friend, a noticeable group or a set of toys?  If #he/she# approaches other children, does #he/she# ask permission to play or does #he/she# simply begin to play in parallel or interactively with the others?  Does #he/she# maneuver to be near a special friend?  What does #he/she# do to reach this goal of being near #his/her# friend:  offer the friend something, say something to the friend, suggest that they do something together?  Get a sense of how #first# communicates friendship and maintains contact with a friend.','Once you have a sense of how #first# communicates and maintains a special relation with a friend, you can make neutral comments once or twice over the span of a week.  For example, you might say, \"You played blocks with your friend Jena today and helped her get a block that she needed.\"  Do this sometime during the day of the event, but not during the event.  Leave the sentence dangling; don\'t expect an answer or follow up from #first#.  Be sure that you phrase your comments as observations rather than as questions.  Let #first# make #his/her# own conclusions about the greater meaning of this observation, such as, \"I help my friends.\"','After #first# has a longer history with a group of children, and some familiarity with revisiting #his/her# day with you, then #he/she# will give more extended responses.  In the example about Jena (above), #first# might continue with, \"and we made a house for the cow.\"  You should continue to make neutral, summarizing comments, such as, \"You made a house with your friend.\"  Do not add, \"That\'s nice.\"  This experience isn\'t about reinforcing a behavior; rather, it helps #first# become more conscious about what it means to be a friend.  Be alert for the strategies #first# uses to gain acceptance into other children\'s play.  Children have an irresistible urge to say \"No,\" when any child asks for permission to enter the play.  Asking direct permission is less effective than helping out right away or adding an interesting embellishment to whatever play is going on.','Your neutral comments can help raise #first#\'s awareness of what #he/she# does to establish a friendship.  #He/She# may even develop an understanding of how #he/she# makes #himself/herself# more vulnerable to rejection.  But remember to use your comments as a reminder of the experience, not as a reminder of what you said #he/she# should do.  Over time, as #first# becomes more aware of #his/her# own behavior patterns, #he/she# will be better able to improve #his/her# relations with others.  ','The Great Debate','Defining friendship by revisiting an argument','We parents are often the witness to an argument between our child and a friend.  We are aware that this argument may be intense, but somehow honors the special status of their friendship.  In what ways are these arguments an opportunity for growth and what is our role during these moments?','Lets say that you overhear an argument between #first# and another.  The argument is more advanced than whose turn it is or who owns something.  For example, it could be that the children are negotiating something about where or what to play, such as, whether to play upstairs or outside.  One child wants to play upstairs, the other, outside.  Ask the children to repeat what they have said into a tape recorder and come to an agreement.  If you do not have a tape recorder, ask them to repeat it to you and you write down their thoughts.  Let them continue to play once the issue has been resolved.  At some relaxed time later in the day, revisit the argument and ask #first# to tell you in #his/her# own words what was going on.  Your objective here is not to shame or directly instruct #first#, but rather to give #him/her# an opportunity to summarize the structure and course of an argument with a friend.','If you think the recording is too advanced, then simply provide a verbal summary of the argument yourself just before the children go upstairs or outside.  \"You wanted to play in different places, you worked it out by talking it over.\"  This may be enough to plant this idea of reflecting on the structure and course of an argument.  Be true to the event.  It could have lead to separation, \"You wanted to play in different places, you yelled at each other, and decided to play separately.\"  Be patient.  Understand that it is consciousness of the structure of a social dynamic that leads to wisdom, not a list of rules.  This means that you should resist saying, \"Don\'t yell at each other.\"','The best part comes when both children can revisit the tape recording or your reading of their words.  See if they can make any comments about what they hear, such as, \"We did what you wanted to do\" or \"you got mad at me.\"  These little comments are one step more reflective than just repeating the exact words, and thereby, indicate the beginning of consciousness about the structure of a social dynamic with a friend.  Try to use the tape recorder when possible, but the tape recorder, unlike the written words, capture the emotional tone of an argument.  This practice of revisiting an argument should help #first# develop strategies of solving disagreements that eventually #he/she# can use at the time of the argument.  ','As has been mentioned, the benefit comes in reflecting on the structure of a social dynamic which in turn will help #first# use this knowledge in the heat of a current conflict.    #first# will make meaning by relating specific memories to more general principles, such as \"listening to her means that she is my friend.\"  Your role as a parent serves to support this important process of meaning making.  Let Parent Partners know about an incident when you have a good feeling about helping #first# make meaning about friendship.','2012-08-22 12:30:11','2012-08-22 12:30:11'),(2730,'s_36_1','Increased and More Able Responses to Others\' Distress','By the time children are three, they are growing more aware of others\' needs and more able to respond to others.  While children do react with interest to others\' distress as early as 6 months [See related Social LW- 6 Months- Reacting With Interest to Other Children\'s Distress] and by 10-11 months, actually become upset when another child is upset [See Related Social LW, 10-11 Months-Responding to the Distress of Others], these responses appear to be less out of empathy as real upset caused by seeing someone else in distress.  Caring behaviors increase in frequency at around 18 months of age (Zahn-Waxler & Radke-Yarrow, 1984), though they are still not common (Eisenberg, 1992), with children more likely to reach out to try to calm the upset child by touching, patting, or doing something to amuse them.  [See related Social LW, 18-20 Months- Increased Frequency of Empatheitc Responses to Others.]  Howes and Farver (1987) found that children were three times more likely to respond prosocially when the child in distress was a friend.  According to Judy Dunn (1988), such behaviors increase in frequency between two and three years old and by three children are growing better able to take the perspective of others and are growing more responsive to others.  Actually reaching out and comforting others is still not common (Eisenberg-Berg & Hand, 199; Iannotti, 1985; Strayer, Wareing, & Rushton, 1979), but children are more likely to reach out than earlier and are more competent in doing so (Hoffman, 1982).  Nancy Eisenberg (1992) provides the example of a three year old realizing that a crying peer would rather have his or her teddy or mother for comfort than the teddy or mother of the observing child.  This increased ability to consider the other child\'s perspective is unlike younger children who may recognize that a peer is upset but may be more likely to offer his or her own teddy or mother as comfort than those of the distressed child (Eisenberg, 1992).  By four to five years of age, research shows (Iannotti, 1985) that sensitivity to the emotional cues of others along with the ability to adopt different perspectives influences children\'s ability to behave prosocially towards others.  (However, as any parent knows, it certainly doesn\'t ensure prosocial behavior!)  Feshbach and colleagues (as cited in Howes & Farver, 1987), found that occasionally four year olds chastised other children about crying.  Howes and Farver (1987) suggest that prior to four, children may not view crying with embarrassment or shame yet.  For an excellent in-depth and accessible review on caring behaviors, the reader is referred to Eisenberg (1992). ','Floppy Will Make You Feel Better','Elly knows what will comfort a friend','Elly has a friend May.  May has a pet rabbit, Fluffy.  Elly has a pet hamster, Fang.  The two girls can often be seen cuddling their pets and talking like young mothers with prams in the park.  Today May is upset.  She is waiting to go to the doctor.  She has been there before for her DPT series of shots and does not want to return to the house of pain.   May and Elly are together at Elly\'s house because the mothers are car pooling to town.  May\'s mother gives May the ten minute warning,  \"We\'ll be going soon, sweetie.  Get you stuff together.\"  May begins to whimper and withdraw.  Elly watches as May shrinks smaller and smaller into her posture of retreat.  May begins to cry openly with scattered sobs for breath.  \"Here May, Take Fluffy.\"   Elly puts Fluffy, in his small cage, next to the picture books that May had planed to take to the doctor\'s office.','It is important to note that Elly did not suggest May take Fang.  Elly might well have done this, since she and May were riding to town together and she knows May well enough to be entrust Fang\'s safety to May.   Elly loves Fang and he makes her feel good.  Nevertheless, Elly knows Fluffy would comfort May more than Fang would even though the reverse would be true for Elly herself.  Elly appreciates this difference so well that she can \"override\" what is inside her in order to consider her friend\'s needs.

This may be necessary, but the shift to the friend\'s perspective should follow quickly on the heals of the personal perspective.  Later you will find that #first# will automatically frame the \"how would you feel\" question as a means to understand how the friend would feel.','You have placed #first# in a context where #he/she# is asked to think about the needs of a friend.  You will help #him/her# consider the relation between what #his/her# friend would enjoy vis a vis what #first# can produce (e.g. \"I can draw a smile, but not much else.\").

','She Wants Them to Play With Her','Thinking about a storybook character\'s feelings','#first# probably enjoys it when you read stories.  On some occasions, particularly when it is a familiar story, you could discuss the meaning or moral of the story.  Lets suppose that you have just read #first# a Bernistan Bears story where Sister Bear feels that she is losing her friends because a new kid on the block has captured everyone\'s attention.

This does not mean that your question had no value.   #first# is learning that a story reader can go into or out of the story frame.  The reader can read the words of the story or the reader can reflect on the meaning of the words in the story.

Earlier research by Piaget (1965) suggested that children begin to differentiate between acts that are deliberate and those that are accidental by age three or four.  Janet Astington Wilde (1993) points out that desire and intention are two different concepts and that it is possible that young children do not differentiate between them.  While much of the time, desires and intentions go hand-in-hand, it is those odd times when they don\'t that shed light on young children\'s lack of differentiation, according to Astington Wilde (1993).  Desire means to want something.  Intention means to do something to bring about an outcome.  Research by Tom Schultz (1980) sheds light on children\'s understanding of intentional causality.  In this research, three year olds could distinguish between something that they meant or intended to do and something that they did by accident.  For instance, in one study, children were asked to point to either a shiny or dull penny while wearing prism glasses.  The glasses influenced how the children saw the pennies so that they often pointed to the wrong one.  Astington and Gopnik (1991) had children pick toys from a bag and found that children were able to distinguish and talk about whether they picked the one they wanted or not and before hand could tell which one they wanted to pick and whether they got the one they were trying to for.

Children begin to construct their play around a common theme.  While children have been engaged in interactive play with parents since infancy and began social play with other children during the second year, they are now able to socially negotiate pretend play.  Researchers have differentiated between two different types of play, sociodramatic play and fantasy play (e.g. Sachs, Goldman, & Chaille, 1985; Smilansky, 1968).  Early social pretend play often tends to be more sociodramatic than fantasy based.  It is defined by scripts that children have observed.  This means that they may use prototypical roles such as mommies and daddies and enact particular events that they have seen.  Children act out dialogues based upon events that they have observed in their social environment (Garvey, 1990; Vygotsky, 1967).  By around three and a half, social pretend play becomes more extensive and more flexible.  It may also involve more fantasy play.  \n\nResearch shows that the language children use in fantasy play is more imaginative and flexible than the language used in sociodramatic play (Corsaro, 1986).  Children negotiate the blueprints for their actions and the nature of the roles for the characters.  Now, instead of enacting stereotyped events such as playing house or cops and robbers in the sense of running around and pretending to shoot robbers, it is common to hear children refer to the specifics of incidents that can occur.  For instance, \"Pretend that a robber comes and you call the police and I hide our jewels.\"  By negotiating such blueprints, children are integrating different ideas and bringing them together into one instance of \"pretend\"--in a sense, they are telling a story.  They can draw upon their growing repertoire of categories, goals, actions and sequences of actions to build increasingly complex stories.  Parents might witness children deciding whether a certain action fits the category of actions of a certain role as they discuss what the robber should and shouldn\'t do.  Children  need to engage in a social give and take to arrive at a blueprint for play that they agree upon.\n','Denzel and Michael Pretend Together:','From Scripted to Negotiated Play','Denzel (age 3.6) and Michael (age 3.9) have been playmates for quite some time.  Michael proposes a game, \"I\'ll be Batman, You be Joker\"  Denzel says \"Okay\" and runs away.  Michael grabs a play telephone, \"What? the Joker? on my way\"  He races after Denzel and points his arms, \"pshh, pshh, pshh!\" \"Fall down, I got you.\"  Denzel falls down.  After a moment, he says \"Pretend I get away okay?\"  Michael says, \"okay\" and Denzel races off and goes in the toy closet.  He waits in there for a few minutes while Michael fiddles with trying to put the phone into his pretend Batman belt.  Denzel comes out and says, \"I don\'t want to be Joker, Pretend I\'m Robin.\"','Denzel and Michael are negotiating their social fantasy play together.  Together they are building the blueprint for the \"story\" and are filling it in with particular actions that they are familiar with (chasing, shooting, and getting a call on the Batphone).  Together, they need to keep the story going, so when Denzel falls down, the game could end but in order to continue it, both boys decide that Denzel should get away.  Denzel seems to be checking his actions a bit more with Michael than vice versa.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that Denzel is slightly younger.  When the pace of the game slows down a bit and Denzel finds himself waiting in the closet for Michael to come find him and Michael doesn\'t appear, Denzel proposes a role switch that brings him into more contact with Michael.','You will overhear #first# negotiate the course of fantasy play with a friend, negotiations that deal with such issues as:\n\n• who gets to be the main character versus the supporting character\n• how the pretend food should be made or served\n• whether an item is used as a symbol or used as itself\n• whether the cast of characters should be expanded to allow a new player to enter the fantasy.\n','Children need opportunities to engage in negotiated social fantasy play with other children.  Denzel and Michael are a fairly good match for each other because they are both able to contribute to the blueprint and decide upon appropriate actions.  While research shows that young children can engage in and be scaffolded by older siblings in social pretend play, it is helpful for children to also have opportunities to figure out what to do with a partner at about the same level.  The social give and take that they engage in helps them to learn how to work with others -- asserting themselves and compromising as appropriate.  You can help provide opportunities for #first# to engage in such play by making sure that #he/she# has social interactions with children of about the same social age range.

Here are a few suggestions.','Begin by giving recurring situations with a common theme a common name.  \"Oh, here we are again, trying to decide who gets to be the main character.\"  Or it could be, \"Ah, this sounds familiar.  This is our situation where we are trying to decide how to work together.\"  Focus on the part of the situation that concerns the interaction of the two children, or you and #first#.  That is, do not say, \"Ah, this is our situation where something is broken.\"  This latter comment does not focus on the person to person interaction. Hopefully your comment will give #first# some pause and some emotional distance from the heat of the situation while still focusing #his/her# on the form of the interaction.  At this point you can progress or stop, depending on #first#\'s state of mind.  It will be helpful to use the word \"negotiate\" at some point. Children love to hear important sounding words, and even more so, love to use them.  \"Could we negotiate a better way to ...... (work together, decide on...., or whatever it is).î  See if these words help you begin a discussion for alternative reactions to the emotional situation.',' If you think #first# is too intense at the moment to distance #himself/herself# and problem solve, simply speak the name of the situation as above and do your usual damage control in a more direct manner.','As you progress to the actual negotiation, give brief descriptive statements as you go and as you finish.  \"We decided that you could be the lead character this time because you saw the movie.\"  or \"We decided that I should hold the board steady while you worked the saw.\"  Avoid overly general statements like, \"We worked well together.\"  The purpose of your support is help #first# become more conscious of the details of negotiation, not simply to feel good about something that #he/she# has no clear idea about. ','\nYou are helping #first# develop the vocabulary of negotiation in the context of real interactions with you or with #first#\'s friend.  This vocabulary becomes a tool of sorts, a set of tools that are more accessible than vague memories.  The words help #first# create enough distance to think about what is going on in general and what might be some alternative ways to strike a compromise. \n','2012-08-22 12:30:11','2012-08-22 12:30:11'),(2733,'s_42_2','Developing the Ability to Create False Beliefs in Others','Between the age of three and four years of age, children learn a lot about how other people\'s minds work.  One of the things that they learn is that it is possible to create false beliefs in others.  While there is evidence (Dunn, 1988) to suggest that as early as two, children may attempt to mislead others in ways that lead to desired outcomes (such as feigning hunger to get a cookie), research suggests that children recognize that certain behaviors get them what they want, not that they understand that they have the ability to create a false belief in someone that then serves to get them what they want (Ruffman, Olson, Ash, & Keenan, 1993).  The ability to intentionally create a false belief in others appears to develop sometime around the age of four. They come to understand what it means to intentionally mislead another person.  [See Related Social LW-48 Months- Reasoning About the Intentions of Others.]  Janet Astington (1993) provides a thoughtful review of the research.  In a series of game-type experiments (Sodian, 1991), children were asked to trick a \"robber\" puppet and help a King puppet by intentionally misleading the robber puppet about where some coins were hidden.  Despite clear evidence that three year olds understood the purpose of the task and how to play the game, they could not intentionally crate a false belief in the robber puppet. (In order to make certain, the researcher devised a parallel task in which the children had to prevent the robber puppet from looking in the right place by making in physically inaccessible as opposed to mentally misleading the puppet.  Three year olds had no difficulty with this task.)  Four year olds on the other hand were very successful at doing so.  Does this mean that children can apply these skills to real life instances?  Astington (1993) suggests that they can and cites additional examples and research by Joan Peskin to support the point.  For instance, according to Peskin (1992 as cited in Astington, 1993), older children often learn to feign interest in a different toy than they really want to play with so that their younger siblings will be happy to play with that toy instead of the toy the older child really wants to play with.  Peskin (1992) did a series of studies that paralleled this situation in which three and four year olds needed to trick a puppet about which of several stickers the child really wanted.  Three year olds were unable to pull it off while four year olds succeeded immediately or quickly learned how.  According to Astington (1993), four year olds are just beginning to understand the nature of false beliefs and in the coming years learn the subtleties of things like white lies, secrets, and tricks. Research (e.g. Ruffman, Olson, Ash, & Keenan, 1993; Wellman & Bartsch, 1988) suggests that three year olds can understand that people have different ideas in their heads and that it is possible to create different possible beliefs.  They were not yet able to take the next step and create a false belief.\n\nResearch by Wimmer and colleagues (1984) shows that children use the work \"lie\" to refer to all untrue statements, until they are about six or seven, whether or not the person who spoke the statement knew it to be a lie or not.  However, even many four year olds have a far more subtle understanding of whether or someone is at blame or not for their actions based on intention.  They were able to use information about intention and disregard positive and negative outcomes to assign blame even when a lie unintentionally caused positive outcomes! \n','Tara Tricks Her Uncle','Thinking about thinking helps Tara be more effective','Tara was playing a game with her uncle, who had a week end job as a mime in the park.  Her uncle would pretend to be Tara\'s mirror reflection.  Everything that Tara did her uncle followed.  She loved this game.  She would stretch to her tip toes and bend to floor just to see Uncle Mac follow the pace.  Today, however, she had a devilish idea.  She put her two hands to her lips knowing Uncle Max would do the same.  She touched her lips again moving her hands up slowly.  Uncle Max now got the idea.  On the third movement Tara moves her hands to her lips with a gleam in her eye.  Max is moving his hands too. But just her hands arrive near her mouth she pushes them quickly to her forehead.  It was too late for Uncle Max.  He continued the routine movement and jammed his hands into his lips upon seeing Tara\'s quicken movement.  Tara laughed uproariously.  So did Uncle Max.','Tara clearly was thinking about what Uncle Max was thinking.  She deliberately lulled him into a routine that she planned to violate.  She understood that if she looked like she was moving hand to mouth and that Uncle Max has already done this two times before, then he would think that this was just another move to the mouth.   She could more easily trick him by doing the movement a different way on the third time.  It would not have worked so easily if she darted her hands to her forehead on the first time.

Someone has said something that is not true, knows that it is not true, but does so for personal comfort or gain: quite a complicated social concept.  Be alert to the next situation where #first# has a reason to think about a lie, either in a story or in an episode with a friend.  (If #first# #himself/herself# is caught in a lie, perhaps that is not the best time to reflect on the lie as a concept).  Lets assume something has happened in a story and you and #first# can talk about the deception.','#first# has indicated that something in the story or a personal experience should be called a lie.  You could query what this means.  \"A fib (#first#\'s word), what could that be?  Tell me, what is a fib anyway.  What does it mean to say that somebody has fibbed?\"','The question might come out of left field and catch #first# unprepared.  This would be the time to recount the episode.  \"When John told his mother that he had not been wadding in the water with his shoes on, you said that he told a fib.  Did he wade in the water?\"  #first# can handle this and says, \"Yeah, he did.\"  You follow, \"But he told his mother that he hadn\'t done it.\"  #first# replies, \"That it, he fibbed.\" You summarize, \"So a fib is when you tell someone something that is not true.\"  \"Sorta\" #first# might say.  Of course the key is that the person telling the untruth knows it is untrue and hides the truth for personal comfort or gain. ','Once you have established that #first# understands that a lie is at least the telling of an untruth, you are in a position to make the assault on the other features, that the person so telling knows it is untrue. \"What if a dog ate your sandwich when you were not looking.  But I thought that your brother had taken your sandwich.  I told you, \'Your brother took your sandwich.\'  Was that a lie?\"   Take a note of what #first# says in reference to this question.  Think of other ways to ask about these differences ever three months on so.','Young children pass through a stage where they believe that a lie is the telling of any untruth, whether intentional or not.  By asking #first# about the level of the lie in situations that vary in intention,  you are helping #first# consider the key features of a full blown lie.  This awareness will help #first# later when #he/she# has to make judgments about the culpability of either #himself/herself# or another.','Just Ask Me','Games That Require an Element of Deception','Invent a game of pretense where to obtain an objective you have to throw someone else off the track.  For example, a rainy day version of hide and seek can be played indoors.  You have hidden something in the room.  #first# sees where you hide it but #he/she# must confuse the other players so that they do not find it.  The longer it takes for the other players to find the hidden object the more points #first# earns.','The players looking for the hidden object can ask #first# anything.  #first# understands that he does not have to tell the truth.  But it will still be hard to mask all knowledge of where the object is hidden.  It takes concentration and a keen sense of deception.','#first# may begin by answering all question with the opposite of the truth.  If a player says, \"Is it under the bed,\" first will say \"yes\" knowing that the object is behind the closet door.  But this opposite messaging would soon become transparent and the players would just wait until #first# said \"no\" to a question about the object\'s whereabouts.  When this happens review for #first#, \"When you say \"yes\" they figure you mean \"no\" so when you said \"no\" they knew that you meant \"yes.\"','After this game is played enough to be familiar you may notice #first# becoming more subtle in #his/her# strategies.  In addition to saying \"yes\" when he means \"no\" #he/she# might also develop a subtle way of glancing over to the sofa chair.  The glance is meant to throw the players off the track because the hidden object is behind the closet door.  (When it is your turn to search you might \"model\" this subtle strategy and then talk about it later).   If #first# uses this strategy it means #he/she# has figured that #his/her# answers to questions no longer confuse the players.  The unasked information, the line of regard of #his/her# glance, might cause the players to think that #first# is unaware that #he/she# is revealing the location of the hidden object.  The players would trust that information more, yet still be fooled.  ','Games of deception are practica for social awareness.  #first# will learn to present an idea in a convincing manner because #he/she# is carefully observing the facial expressions of the other players.  While these games might seem antisocial, remember that they are just games.  Every good card player knows the subtle art of deception.  And once learned, this form of social knowledge can be put to good use, such as in reading a situation where someone might be deliberately trying to deceive.   Therefore, the long term effect of these games could be a element of self protection and consumer savvy.  ','2012-08-22 12:30:12','2012-08-22 12:30:12'),(2734,'s_48_1','Reasoning about the Intentions of Others','By as early as two and three years old, children will talk about whether or not they did something \"on purpose\" or \"meant to do it\" (Astington & Gopnik, 1991; Dunn, 1988; Schultz, 1980)  [See Related Social LW- 36 Months- Reasoninbg About One\'s Own Intentions.] When do they begin to include intention in their reasoning about the behavior of others?  It appears that this ability develops sometime between the third and fifth year.  Astington and Lee (1991) told children a story in pictures where a little girl took bread crumbs from her mother and dropped them on the ground and birds came to eat them.  They then told a story about a little girl who went outside to eat bread from her mother and dropped some crumbs that birds then ate.  They found that 3 year olds could not tell them which girl meant to feed the birds whereas five year olds could.  Astington (1993) explains the task as one where children had to think about the girl\'s desire for an outcome and then consider whether the desire caused an intention for the outcome to occur.  \n\nMany four year olds are able to judge whether someone is at blame or not based on intention.  Wimmer, Gruber, and Perner (1984) gave children a task where a boy thought some chocolate was in spot A.  Unbeknownst to the boy, someone had moved it to spot B.  The boy\'s sister asks him where the chocolate is.  In one version, he wants his sister to find the chocolate, so he tells her where he thinks it is (this is the wrong spot, now).  In a second version, he doesn\'t want his sister to have the chocolate, so he tells her the opposite spot from where he thinks it is (this is actually the right spot, now).  Even the four year olds judged the boys actions on his intentions--in the first case, the boy wasn\'t blamed and in the second case he was even though the outcome was the opposite!  However, it appears that how four year olds assign blame is partly related to what the outcomes are.  In cases where the outcomes that were clearly bad, in that they caused bodily harm, broken objects, or explicitly hurt feelings, younger children found it harder to judge solely on intention (Rybash, Roodin, & Hallion, 1979; Surber, 1982; Wimmer et al., 1982).\n','The Doctor Hurt the Boy','The difference between wanting to and having to.','Christine and her family were watching an early evening show on television about a country doctor.  Just before commercial an emotional moment came when the doctor had to set and splint a broken bone.  A young boy had fallen from a tree and broken his arm.  The doctor knew that the first few moments would hurt the boy, but it had to be done quickly in order to prevent further damage to the boy\'s arm.  Christine winched when the young boy cried out as the doctor set the bone straight.  During the commercial the mother asked Christine about the doctor, \"Why did the doctor do that.   It certainly hurt the boy?\"    Christined thought for a minute, and said, \"He had to fix his arm.\" ','The episode deals with the difference between intention and desire.  The doctor intended to cause the boy pain, but he did not desire to cause the boy pain.  We do not know the depth of Christine\'s understanding of this difference, but she did say \"he had to.\"  This comment could mean the she knew he did not want to, but in order to fix the arm, he had to.  If Christine\'s mother had asked a follow up question, we might have learned if she was angry at the doctor.   The social issue here pivots on whether the viewer should be upset with or have sympathy for the doctor.  ','Even in the life of a young child social situations emerge that require a reading of the difference between a desired and intended act, or between an accidental and an intended act.\n\n• Should a friend be punished for accidentally spilling milk versus intentionally turning the glass over.\n• Should #first# get angry at a friend who accidental bumped into #him/her# while walking without looking or who intentionally ran #him/her# over on the way to the slide ladder.\n• Should a mother be disliked because she had to leave her child at preschool to go to work, even though the child was crying loudly.',NULL,'He Did It On Purpose','Taking time to think about intentions','#first# has just made a comment about an incident in terms of intentionality.  It could be something like \"I didn\'t mean to do it.\"  Or it could be \"He did it on purpose\"  Or it could be \"It was an accident.\"  Once you begin to hear these form of phrases you can follow them up with a brief reflection.','Take the a case where #first# says, \"He did it on purpose.\"  This comment is made in a situation where you are rather certain that the protagonist did not do it on purpose.  What do you say.  Your first entry could be to ask #first# to say a little more.  Something like, \"What do you mean?\" or \"Tell me what you are thinking.\"  You and #first# have probably developed a familiar phrase already, one that #first# understands.  However, the phrase \"How do you know?\" in many cases causes children to retreat from the conversation because this phrase sounds like a request for \"proof\" rather than a simple request to continue the conversation.','If #first# has very little to say after #his/her# initial \"He did it on purpose\" then you can begin with a descriptive statement yourself.  \"Arthur bumped you from behind and he did this on purpose.\"  The most common reaction from #first# at this point would be a simple nod.  The encounter may end at this, which is o.k.  But if #first# is still available for another comment, you could engage #him/her# to think about Arthur.   Arthur was throwing the ball in the air and he bumped you just before the ball came down.\"  Your comments are factual.  You are mainly giving #first# another pair of eyes.  You are not trying to convince #him/her# #he/she# is wrong.','You can expect #first# to say more about #his/her# interpretation of blame as #he/she# grows older.  \"Yeah, he ran right into me.\"   With this level of commentary you can venture a question about antecedents.  \"And what was Arthur doing just before he ran into you.\"  If #first# saw this antecedent he could say, \"Playing ball.\"  It is not necessary for you to complete the logic by saying, \"Then maybe he did it by accident.\"   Whenever possible it is best to allow #first# to make that extension of the logic.  But you could say, \"Arthur was playing ball and he bumped into you.\"  This serves as a memory aid and increases the chance that #first# will think about the relation between actions and intentions.  ','By not offering the final conclusion, e.g. \"Then maybe he did it by accident\" you are showing your trust in #first# ability to think.  This trust is the most important lesson.   If #first# feels that you trust #his/her# ability to think about the relation among facts, then #he/she# will be relaxed enough to give #himself/herself# the extra time that is needed to think more deeply.   #first# will internalize your attitude toward #his/her# ability to think and that in turn will determine #his/her# ability to think.','The Unintended Kindness','Knowing that good acts can be accidental','There are times when good things happen accidentally.  But understanding that these events are accidents is difficult.  Children often think that if the act yielded something good that it was obviously intended by the perpetrator.  Look for such a situation in order to revisit it with #first#.  It could happen that a small child comes over and starts to play with a puzzle that #first# had left out on the table from yesterday\'s play.  The young child\'s mother says, \"Janine really enjoyed playing with the puzzles that you set out for her.\"  In fact, #first# did not know yesterday that Janine was coming over.','This would not be the time to take matters into your own hands and clarify that #first# had no such intentions.  But after Janine\'s mother has left you might ask #first# what he thought.  \"Tell me, what was Janine\'s mother thanking you about, something about the puzzles.\"  This question gives #first# the chance to revisit the assumptions Janine\'s mother was making about intentions.','Such a question may require more reflection than #first# can marshal.  If this is your sense of the matter, then begin somewhat differently.  \"It seems that Janine\'s mother thought you had put the puzzle out specifically for Janine.\"  This comment can be enough.  It would only make #first# feel small if you asked #him/her# to agree or disagree with this assumption about #first#\'s good intentions.','If you had begun the revisiting with a question to #first#, and #he/she# gave some comment, then you are in the position to offer a follow up summary.  Suppose that #first# answered, \"That\'s o.k.\" when you said that Janine\'s mother had assumed the puzzle was placed deliberately for Janine.  \"It is o.k., as long as Janine had a good time.\"  ','The objectives of these encounters are mainly to raise #first# consciousness that even things that are very enjoyable for people can be unintended.  Ultimately this realization will help #first# make judgments about personal merit.  But at this young age you are merely raising the subject.

This is in part because it depends upon how one defines sharing and what it is that is being shared.  As Judy Dunn (1988) notes, there are many instances when infants hand objects over to others in what can be an ambiguous gesture.  As early as 18 months, children do seem to understand what their peers or sibling want and will occasionally offer it (Dunn, 1988).  While it is not uncommon for children under two to engage in such exchanges (Rheingold & Hay, 1978), Dunn questions whether these actions really constitute sharing in the sense of freely offering a valued good.  She cites a review by Radke-Yarrow, Zahn-Waxler, and Chapman (1983) that includes little evidence of sharing by young children under the age of two.  While research on two and three year olds suggests that they do share, the category is often lumped together with other forms of prosocial behaviors, making it difficult to assess just how much sharing younger children do.  Naturalistic research conducted by Dunn and colleagues (1988) noted that the frequency of sharing episodes did not increase in any discernable way between the ages of 18 and 36 months of age. Sharing behavior does appear to increase between the ages of four and five (Eisenberg-Berg & Hand, 1979).  This is about the same time that children are learning to delay their own gratification and are learning to understand more about the wants and needs of others.  Research shows that children who are better at perspective-taking are also more likely to share with others (Underwood & Moore, 1982). Whether or not children share also appeared to depend in part on what is to be shared.  Toys were less readily shared, whereas food and candy were shared with greater ease (Dunn, 1988). This is particularly interesting given that food and candy are comsumable items.  Parents also conveyed different expectations about the sharing of different types of items. [See related Parent Social Mediation Window, 48 Months.]  \n\nEisenberg, Lennon, & Roth (1983) describe two levels of prosocial behavior typical of preschoolers.  The first is a hedonistic, self focused orientation where the child is concerned with his or her own gains.  The second orientation is a reference to the needs of others in the simplest terms.  When preschoolers did share, they tended to stress the needs of the person to be shared with (Eisenberg & Neal, 1979) as in the second orientation.  It was common for children to say things like, \"I gave her some play-doh because she needed it.\"  Sharing also has its social benefits (Dunn, 1988; Eisenberg, 1993) and children are more inclined to share with others whom they consider to be friends and to include references to friendship as a basis for their actions (Eisenberg, 1993). \n','Shared Shovels in the Sand','When giving is sharing and when it\'s not.','Melissa and Jessie were working at the sand table building an intricate sets of water channels and damns.  The sand table was jaxed up on one end so that the water would flow in one direction and exit a screened drain.  Melissa was digging out a big hole in the sand so that the water would pool there before continuing it\'s path downstream.  Jessie was trying to compact the sand with her hand to make a damn and decided she really needed the shovel to pound the sand more firmly than she could do with her hand.  Melissa was about half way done with her pond when Jessie asked, \"Quick Melissa, give me the shovel so I can make my damn.\"  Melissa wanted to finish her pond, but saw that Jessie\'s damn was eroding where the sand was lose.  She sacrificed her shovel so that Jessie could pound the sand.  When Jessie was done she passed the shovel back to Melissa who continued to finish her pooling pond in a few more digs.','Melissa had shared her shovel with Jessie.  This act of sharing was more than passing an object to Jessie that Jessie wanted.   If there had been two shovels and Melissa took a few moments to hand the second shovel to Jessie, that would not have been sharing.  Had Melissa passed Jessie the one and only shovel at a moment when Jessie did not need it, that also would not have been sharing either.  The social concept of sharing implies several things.  First, the object that is passed needs to be valued by the passer (Melissa was still using the shovel).  Second, the person who passes the object needs to know that the recipient desires the object (Melissa knew that Jessie\'s damn was in jeopardy).  Else wise the recipient is treated more like shelf space than a person receiving a requested item.  Sharing involves an important structure of an object that is desired by two people and relinquished by one. ','Sharing involves both a person who gives and a person who wants to receive.  \nThink of the following situations, some imply sharing, some do not.\n\n• #first# gives his used napkin to his teacher (not sharing)\n• #first# gives his friend a crayon out of the blue (not sharing, but certainly a nice gift and a prosocial behavior).\n• #first# pulls a friend in the wagon (This could be sharing if the roles are reversed from time to time and it is clear that #first# enjoys being the rider.

The children could set it whenever they had to share one-of-a-kind items.  Usually in these situations new games emerge where the children have fun trying to \"beat the clock\" in doing a task.  A large three minute egg timer (sand glass) is simple to use and provides a continuous mark of decreasing time.  If the egg timer creates more problems than it solves, do not use it.   Three minutes will not fit all situations equally well.','The biggest benefit is the message that the quality of play can be improved with a little planning and forethought.  You want to give as much emphasis on an attitude of generosity as well as a structured environment.  And if you find the kitchen timer idea agreeable, all sorts of time based thinking can result.   And even if the kitchen timer or egg timer is not used precisely, the timer as a symbol reminds the children that a borrowed object is on loan for a finite period of time.','Can I Borrow Your Cookie?','Appreciating the sacrifice of a generous friend','There are times when #first# will accuse someone of not sharing when the problem is more complicated than that.

Detour ability  emerges gradually during infancy, as children first develop the ability to reach around a barrier before they develop the ability to locomote around it.  This ability to detour also develops more quickly with opaque barriers than transparent ones (Lockman, 1984, p.490). Several experiments have provided information into the development of detour behaviors in infants and toddlers and the use of a two choice maze.\n\nAlthough  detour ability appears by the end of the first year, young children and infants are limited by a predisposition to repeatedly search in the same direction as their first trial, even when this is not the correct choice. When testing 9, 13, 17, 21 and 25 month old children in one study conducted by John Rieser et al. (1982), the 9 month old children who moved through a two choice maze displayed a \"predisposition bias\", repeating their errors across all trials, correcting only 18% of errors.  There was a reduction of this predisposition bias with age, as the older subjects  corrected 81% of errors.  This is consistent with other research which indicates that infants tend to repeatedly search for hidden objects in the same location as their initial search, regardless of success of failure of finding the object (Gratch, 1975; Harris, 1975; Piaget, 1963; in Rieser, et al., 1982, p. 718). \n\nIn another similar experiment conducted by C. Donald Heth and Edward H. Cornell (1980), one year old children appeared to learn for their errors, correctly selecting the open route of a two path maze following an initial error, only after they had previously viewed their parent move through the maze successfully.  In this instance, children corrected their errors, perhaps because they knew that a correct route did exist, they simply did not know where (Heth & Cornell, 1980, p. 259 260).\n','Emilee is determined to get behind the sofa.',NULL,'Emilee’s father used to keep his magazine collection on the bottom shelf of the end table next to the sofa.

They begin to base these judgments on estimates of the absolute size of the object instead of comparing relative sizes.  Baillargeon and DeVos (Baillargeon, 1991; Baillargeon & DeVos, 1991) showed children a cloth with a lump in it.  Then they slid a  screen in front of the cloth.  They showed children either a small toy dog that matched the size of the lump or a large toy dog that was much too big to have been the lump. At 12 and 1/2 months, children did not show surprise at the size of the dog, however, at 13 and 1/2 months children did react with surprise.  Since they could not compare the size of the dog to the size of the lump, this suggests that they were able to compare absolute size as opposed to relative size.  Younger children would react in surprise if they could simultaneously compare the size of the lump \nand the size of the object.  Comparing the absolute size also entails a memory task.  Children need to recall the lump and compare what they recall to the size of the toy dog.\n','Elliot is furious when offered half an ice cream sandwich.',NULL,'Elliot has been shopping with his family.

The early scribbles of young children have been analyzed by researchers who have identified twenty different types of scribble markings.  Researchers have also observed children as they scribble and have determined that these variations in scribbles are caused by changes in hand motions which attempt to prevent muscle fatigue (Kellogg, 1969).  These scribble markings, which are usually placed one on top of another, are the result of spontaneous hand movement and do not require visual guidance, which is often made evident in the overlap of scribbles from paper onto other surfaces (Eddowes, 1995).  As children continue to scribble over time, they begin to develop a sense of figure/ground relationships and may begin to place marks in specific patterns and places on paper (Eddowes, 1995; Kellogg, 1969).  It is not, however, until children are approximately 24 26 months old that they begin to create shapes and designs in their drawing (Kellogg, 1969).

However, if the colors are very bright and prototypical (red, blue, yellow) and the shapes are not so distinct, children will attend to color over shape (Odom, Astor, & Cunningham, 1975).

Understanding size constancy means perceiving that an object\'s size remains the same even when it is farther away and the object\'s image on the eye changes.  For example, a child standing in front of us appears the same size as when they are across the street, even though the image of the child on our eye is larger when they are in front of us.  \n\n \nResearch by McKenzie and colleagues (1980) suggests that understandings of size constancy continue to grow throughout infancy and toddlerhood and that children become able to judge size constancy at a variety of distances.  McKenzie and colleagues (1980) wanted to further test the ability of infants to detect size constancy of an object when viewed at various distances and not directly compared with another sized object.  The researchers presented 18 , 26  and 33 month old infants with a large object at a distance of  60 centimeters in the familiarization period of the experiment.  They then presented the infants with the original large object and a smaller object at close and far viewing distances to test whether infants attend the viewing size or the real size of an object.  They found that the 26  and 33 month old infants looked at objects for the same amount of time in conditions where the original, large object was used, regardless of viewing distance.   In the conditions where the object was a different size, the looking time of the infants was greater than in the \"same size\" conditions, indicating that they had perceived the change in the object\'s real size. This result indicates that the infants perceived the constancy of the object real size across trials, regardless of viewing distance and retinal image size.  The 18 month old infants in this study did not display any significant differences in looking time across conditions, thereby suggesting that the ability to perceive visual size constancy across a variety of distances is not operative until sometime between 18 and 26 months of age.  \nConclusions drawn from a number of studies indicates that soon after birth, infants can perceive differences between the real size and the retinal size of an object, suggesting that it is an organizing feature of perception (Slater, Mattock & Brown, 1990; McKenzie, Tootell, & Day, 1980). By 6 8 months of age (McKenzie et al, 1980), infants can perceive the size constancy of an object when it is viewed at various distances and not directly compared with differently sized objects.  (Some 4 month olds have size constancy, but research shows that it depends on the maturity of their binocular vision (Vasta, Haith, & Miller, 1992). Granrud (1986, as cited in Vasta, Haith, & Miller, 1992) found that four month olds with fully developed binocular vision had size constancy, but those without binocular vision did not have size constancy.) The research also suggests that this ability emerges over time and is still somewhat limited even at eight months, as these infants have significant difficulty detecting size constancy beyond about 70 centimeters away (McKenzie, Tootell, & Day, 1980).  The ability to judge sizes with changes in distance emerges over time and is still developing up to about 10 or 11 years of age (Day, 1987, as cited in Vasta, Haith, & Miller, 1992).\n','Daddy is Across the Street.',NULL,'Jacob knows his father Ben is wearing a red coat today.

The child may even make the sound of the car as they draw the line.  \n\n \nThe actual product may not be intended \"to be\" anything and the resulting \"artwork\" is often not interesting to children as products, rather they are about the process of making the scribbles.   Parents who are interested in their child\'s work as a product are sometimes surprised at their child\'s lack of interest in his or her artwork.  In fact, parents who wish to save their child\'s early work often find themselves collecting it from the floor or toybox.

When researchers replaced children\'s markers with ones that didn\'t leave any marks, the children soon lost their interest in scribbling (Gibson & Yonas, 1968).  \n\nChildren of this age tend to experiment with different kinds of scribbles and in so doing engage is a series of different types of moves (Gardner, 1980).  For instance, the making of dots involves a sharp pounding activity (and often so much arm movement that not all of the dots end up on the page!)  Often a great deal of pressure is applied to creating angles and making the requisite shift in direction into the process.  Wavy lines often entail calmer movements whereas zigzags may entail a slightly frenetic (and perhaps hard to control shifting of direction.) (Gardner, 1980).  These moves are important to the production of the scribbles and receive great concentration.  The action often receives more attention than what ends up on the page and indeed what ends up on the page may reflect less control that the physical control of the movements that created it (Gardner, 1980).\n',NULL,NULL,'Janine is making marks on a paper taped to her desk top.

The movement of her hand were provoked by the movement of the wings, not by the silhouetted contour of the humming bird\'s body.  Action of shadow lead to action of hand.

Between 18 and 24 months, with the increased development of mental representation and object permanence, children are increasingly able to organize a search for an object  particularly if the contexts are somewhat familiar.  They can form mental representations of movements and actions and can visualize what might have happened to an object that they can\'t see.\n\nIn a study comparing 13 , 20  and 30 month old babies, children at 20  and 30 months exhibited more successful searches for a hidden object than the 13 months olds.  The 20  and 30 month olds were even able to successfully search for a hidden object when there were several different hiding places and when the container under which the object was hidden was moved to a different location (Sophian, 1985).  These children were able to make the inferences involved to follow the series of hidden displacements of the object.\n\n \nSome research suggests that younger babies (8 to 12 months) have more success at tracking displaced objects if they don\'t need to wait very long before searching them out.  The longer they waited, the more errors they made (Baillargeon, DeVos, & Graber, 1989; Harris, 1989; Wellman, Cross, & Bartsch, 1986).  These errors are attributed in part to the limitations on infants\' short term memory and suggests that children\'s search behaviors grow less fragile as their ability to remember grows.  As children grow older, they are better able to hold items in their short term memory for use in searching for a hidden object (Wellman, Cross & Bartsch, 1986 in Harris, 1989).  Researchers explain that when children initially view an object being hidden at location A, it is stored first in their short term and then in their long term memory.  When young children (8 12 months) later view the object hidden at location B (information which is stored in their short term memory) and are forced to wait 30 seconds before retrieving it, these younger children revert back to the information stored in long term memory to search for the object at A.  As children grow older they are better able to store information in their short term memory and use this to correctly search for the hidden object at B (Wellman, Cross & Bartsch, 1986; Harris, 1989).  More recent research suggests that it is not only the memory demand that differentiates performance of younger and older children.  In addition to remembering that the object is no longer at A but at B, the infant must also inhibit the tendency to reach to A.  Some researchers argue that children\'s brains may not be well enough developed to enable them to inhibit the tendency to reach towards A even if they can remember that the object is at B (e.g. Diamond, 1991a, 1991b).\n\nUnderstanding spatial information about the environment enables children to move from exploratory behavior to search behavior (Wright & Vlietstra, 1975).  With the ability to use spatial information and to store information in short term memory for longer periods of time, older children can more carefully organizing search behaviors in goal oriented patterns. \n','Sam Looks Where Last Found','The primacy of motor memory over visual memory','Sam is playing with a rubber set of wheels on a table top.

Then Flash leaves as quickly as he came, and Sam remembers his interest in the toy.  He looks behind of a green truck, the place where he found the wheels in the first place.  He lifts the truck, but is surprised when he discovers that the rubber wheels are not there.  ','Sam was on his way to retrieve the wheels behind the books because he has a strong visual memory for its location when the wheels disappeared.  But when the dog distracted him, his visual memory gave way to the memory for his last action.  He moved toward the truck once again, because that is where he moved some minutes ago when he first found the interesting set of wheels.  No doubt, if the dog had not caused Sam to delay his move toward the books, he would have successful retrieved the wheels.','#first# will have to organize search behavior in situations that vary in difficulty.

Instead, it passes through a period of time when children are interested in creating designs.  These designs follow certain forms and are often repeated and combined in different ways (Kellogg, 1969) as though the child is experimenting with a language of symbols for drawing (Gardner, 1980).  Researcher Rhoda Kellogg identified a set of 20 patterns that children tend to make with some of the earliest patterns being zig zagging, curvy, or looped lines (Kellogg, 1959).  However, later research suggests that these forms are not so obvious in the drawing of all children and that the predominant forms are \"whirls, loops, and circles\" and \"multiple, densely patterned, parallel lines\" (Golomb, 1981 as written about in Cox, 1992).   \n\nAround this time, children are also beginning to pay attention to where they place shapes on the page and tend to pay attention to positioning and borders. (Kellogg, 1969 as cited in Winner, 1982).  Children often use scribbling motions to fill out what takes shape as a circle or triangle and takes a particular position on the sheet of paper.  By the time children are three, they often convert to using a single line instead of these scribbled in shapes (Kellogg, 1969 as cited in Winner, 1982). Common patterns were circles, ovals, squares, rectangles, triangles, crosses and X\'s (Kellogg, 1969 as cited in Winner, 1982).  According to Gardner (1980), children begin to rehearse their vocabulary of forms, and around age three, eventually juxtaposing or and then beginning to combine them.  Common combinations include circles with triangles or squares in them or the mandela pattern of a circle with a cross inside (Kellogg, 1969). \n\nParents may notice preschoolers \"rehearsing\" different shapes and designs and achieving greater distinction between the shapes as they do.  The angles are sharpened and shapes become more defined.  Squares begin to look less like circles, straight lines less like wavy lines.  Eventually children create long lines and short lines, zig zagging, curved and straight lines.  There is a great deal of variation in children\'s experimentation and different children may create different kinds of patterns.  For instance, one child may experiment with putting bold marks on a page while another makes wavy lines reminiscent of writing.  Research shows that children tend to scribble for differing periods of time and that for some youngsters there is a fair amount of overlap between their scribbling explorations and their early representational drawing (Golomb, 1981).\n\nWinner (1982) suggests that this \"design stage\" is not necessary even if it is common based on some research with 8 9 year olds from different cultures who created representational drawings immediately (Alland, as originally cited in Gardner, 1980).  Such a comparison creates difficulties, however, given that children will have achieved representation in other domains and supporting abilities, such as fine motor skill, will have progressed beyond what 2  to 3 year olds are capable of.\n',NULL,NULL,'Bobby is using a set of good quality markers.

She dashes down the stairs, turns to face the couch and goes directly to the correct side to retrieve her lost treasure.  \"Gotcha\" she exclaims with pride. ','Claudia was able to \"translate\" what she saw into a set of movements that took her directly to her toy.  To do this she had to make some sort of mental representation of where the toy was, since she could no longer see the toy as she descended the stairs, nor could she see the toy when she arrived at the front of the couch.  Claudette\'s \"simply\" little feat tells us that she has a rather well developed sense of space that includes her ability to know what is where even when she changes her own orientation to that spot and even when she loses visual contact with the object.  She not only knows that what she saw from above is the same as what she sees when on the ground floor, but also she knows how to use the information that she constructed while looking from above.','Be alert for those times that #first# looks at a large space in order to figure how to get around.\n\n• #first# stands at the kitchen window and watches where a chipmunk went into a bed of leaves.  ##he/she## goes outside and turns toward that spot, even though the spot has no landmark features.\n• #first# rides with you down an escalator in department store, looks down and sees Santa on the left talking to the children.

The teachable moment occurs whenever you are at a lookout point and can see the larger space below where #first# wants to play.  Instead of just entering the space ask first to decide where #he/she# wants to go.  Watch to see how #first# looks over the playspace to help #him/her# remember where this prefered spot is.   If #first# has to turn #his/her# back on the playspace, e.g. walking down a flight of stairs, before entering the playspace, then the challenge to spatial thinking is all the better.

','Leaving to find','object outside','This game may be played because an opportunity arises or because you have prepared the environment somewhat.  Whichever way it starts, ask #first# if #he/she# can go get an item that can be seen from a higher elevation.  It could be an Easter egg in the yard seen from the swing set ladder, it could be a lost shoe seen by standing on the bed, it could be favorite ball in the yard  seen from the second story window.  The situation is a greater challenge if #first# can not see the item when #he/she# is on the ground. ','You could say, #first#, think you can find the xx?   See it over there.

','The encounter will be rather easy if the object is hidden behind something that is itself well defined, such as behind a bright chair.  This form of the game could be played as a warm up and as a way just to define the rules of the game.  Another warm up could be simply to have #first# watch from afar as you hide the object.  Then #first# has to remember where you put it.  Sometimes have two identical objects that could cover the object, such as two identical pillows spaced apart.','You can think of ways to make the game more challenging.  If the object lays behind one of two identical screens, then #first# really has to think about spatial relations.  If #he/she# sees the object from the elevated height and the object is behind the right screen, then #he/she# has to remember that spatial relation when #he/she# climbs down and can not long see the object. \nRemember, in this version, #first# does not have the benefit of actually seeing the your actually place the object anywhere, the object is already there.\n','These search activities, which could be presented with an increasing difficulty, will help #first# develop strategies for keeping track of where things are.

But you know that once #he/she# goes out into the yard there are a number of visual barriers that will prevent him from seeing the tricycle upon entering the yard.  Therefore, while #he/she# is looking from the higher elevation #he/she# has to think about which way to walk to get to the tricycle.','Point out to #first# that #he/she# might not be able to see the tricycle once #he/she# goes out the door unto the playground.

You will have to remember because you may not see it right away when you go outside.\"  Allow #first# to construct #his/her# own way of mentally marking the position of the tricycle  Refrain from saying to #him/her#, \"Remember, the tricycle in next to the garage.\"  See if #first# can tell you how #he/she# is going to remember where the tricycle is located.','If first seems distracted or is not treating this initial viewing of the space as an opportunity to get information, then you have to consider some modification of this encounter.  Perhaps #first# is not interested in riding #his/her# tricycle.  At this point simply ask first \"What can you see from up here?\"  Once you have established that #first# has identified something, then propose that you go out to see if it is still there when you go outside or to retrieve the object if it can be moved.  Try to target something that might be harder to see from the front door than from the window.  ','Later you can engage #first# in a more challenging way.  You can ask #first# directly to tell you what objects will be hard to find, that is, what objects are easier to see from the window than from the front door.  If #first# can not offer any suggestions, feel free to offer one or two yourself, just as a model.  On some other day #first# will be able to offer you an idea.','In general this encounter helps #first# to plan and more specifically to beyond casual looking.  In this encounter #first# is looking in order to find landmarks and visible anchors that can be used later to find the object in the yard.  This disposition, to find information for future action while looking out over a large space, will be important in many situations.  For example, in playing your way through a crowd, in finding the exit in a public building,  in locating his seat again in movie theater after going out for popcorn.  The ability to view large spaces and scan them for locations landmarks is a general skill with many practical life applications.

During this time period, children often make their initial steps towards representation often in what is almost an incidental manner.  Portions of their scribbles may become partly, then increasingly distinct, at which point children might announce it to be a certain object.  Researchers refer to this as \"romancing towards representation\" (e.g. Gardner, 1980; Winner, 1982) or \"fortuitous realism\" (Luquet, 1913; 1927). This is because it is viewed as a type of wishful thinking  the child creates something, pauses, looks at it, and grants it the status of an entity or a shape.  While this is quite different from how three and four year old children announce what they are going to make and then set out to create it, it reflects an emergent understanding that what is drawn on the paper can symbolize something and that this can be shared and communicated to others.  Children become increasingly concerned with the visual likeness between what they\'ve drawn and what they it can look like, eventually becoming interested in intentionally making it stand for something (Cox, 1992). This then involves them in solving the problem of creating the marks in certain ways. (Cox, 1992)  in \"searching for equivalents\" (Goodnow, 1977; Arnheim, 1974).     \n\nA common first shape that gets \"romanced\" into something else is a simple closed loop (Winner, 1982).  In scribbling, children commonly construct closed loops.  The loop begins to stand out as a distinct pattern but not necessarily as a representation of something  children begin to intentionally make the loop.  Then they might proceed to  label it. The closed loop eventually leads to the creation of a circle  considered the easiest shape for children to create.  Research shows that even though children seldom intentionally set out to create representational drawings in a spontaneous fashion before they around age three, that if asked to fill in portions of a face or to draw part of an object, even two year olds are able to do so (e.g. Freeman, 1977; 1980; Ives, Wolf, Fucigna & Smith as cited in Cox, 1992). This suggests that even if they aren\'t able to spontaneously produce as representational picture, they do possess developing understandings.\n\nAdults and older children may \"push\" two year olds towards romancing before the child is developmentally there by asking \"What is that?\" when the child has completed a drawing.  As in the scribbling described above, the child may not have intended it to be anything. \n',NULL,NULL,'Holly has a set of colored wooden blocks on the table before her.  She has already built one of her usual towers, stacking three or four blocks on top of each other.  But today she looks at a lone green block in a space by itself.  This time she lowers the red block in her hand to the table near the green block, then slowly and deliberately slides the red block until it comes to rest next to the green.  At this point she releases the red block, studies her two block row, and lifts a third block to add it to her row.  As she lowers the third  block toward the table she also, at the same time, moves it toward the row.  Without sliding the third block,  Holly places it directly into the corner made by the vertical face of the second block and surface of the table.   ','These subtle movements indicate that Holly has begun to relate one block to more than a single surface.  In making a stack, all Holly has to do is relate the bottom of the top block to the top of the bottom block.  But in making a row she is beginning to relate two sides of the moving block to side of the row and the surface of the table.  Her first move, that is sliding the red block, allows her to break this double relation into a step 1 step 2 sequence.  First place block to table top, then place block to side of the row.  But by the time she goes for the third block she has integrated these two relations into a single fluid action.   At the same time that she moves the third block toward the table surface she also moves it toward the vertical facet of the row, filling the space without a sliding action. ','Building with blocks can often require #first# to think about two surfaces at once.  Here are some other occurrences\n\n• Placing a lintel across two blocks to make an open arch\n• Trying to make a set of cubes into a curved row\n• Leaning two blocks against each other so that they support each other\n\nNote:  While these example all require #first# to think about two surfaces at once, they are different in their difficulty for reasons discussed elsewhere.\n','Occasionally when #first# builds with blocks, #he/she# creates situations where it is important to think about the spatial relation between one block and two other surfaces simultaneously.

Try at least two different size scales for #first#.  If #he/she# is having a little difficulty with one scale, try the other.  Notice which blocks #he/she# uses the most often.

That is, when you give #first# the second triangle, #he/she# might quickly build another two block tower of cubes and then place the second triangle as a crown.  Each time you do this #he/she# might make another three block structure like the first two.

Harriet Johnson defined seven stages.  At first, very young children tend to carry blocks around with them rather than actually build with them.  At approximately 27 months of age, children pass through Johnson\'s second stage of block building development.  At this stage, children begin to build with blocks making piles by stacking blocks vertically on top of one another and making rows horizontally by placing blocks on a surface next to each other  (Forman, 1982, p.113 114; Gesell, 1940, p.222; Guanella, 1934, p.89).  Research has shown that toddlers first tend to place blocks on one another before they place blocks next to one another (Forman, 1982, p.128; Gura, 1992, p.53).   With an increase in age there is an increase in the number of blocks with which children build and an increase in the amount of discrimination children use to select blocks with which to build (Forman, 1982, pp.109, 125; Johnson, 1933, p.24).  The placement of blocks on one another now leads to the building of towers and piles, and the placement of blocks by one another leads to the building of rows (Reifel, 1984, p.62).\n\nAt approximately 31 32 months of age, children begin to develop the ability to take blocks from stack A to create a new pile or to add them to stack B, creating the inverse of stack A (Forman, 1982, p.118 119) .  Spacing blocks near each other, (without touching) creating a vacant space or enclosure may appear in some children\'s block building at this age (Forman, 1982, p.110; Johnson, 1933, p.19).  Children are also able to place blocks inside containers such as boxes or cans at this time (Gesell, 1940;  Reifel, 1984, p. 62). This advance in children\'s block building creates opportunities for them to explore spatial concepts such as \"on top of,\" \"next to,\" \"beside,\" \"by,\" \"near\" and so on.  [See VS LW- 42 Months for an explanation of the later stages that children pass through.]  \n\nChildren create repetitive patterns in this early form of block building.   The 30 32 month old child\'s creation of piles, rows and towers during block building is done repetitively, as each form evolves gradually into a more complex construction.  The child at this stage of development varies his or her building technique and form, creating more complicated block formations (Johnson, 1933, p.8; Forman, 1975, p.23).  For example, as the child repetitiously builds a tower of blocks, and places those towers side by side, the child discovers the technique for building a wall.  Likewise, repetition and combination of  building methods leads to new and more elaborate block constructions  (Gura, 1992, p.56; Johnson, 1933, p.11).  While children at 30 32 months may name their block buildings, these forms usually include minimal detail and typically serve no function and are not used in dramatic play (Guanella, 1934, p.89; Johnson, 1933, p.34).  \n','Circles beget patches','Raymand discovers the figure/ground in drawings','Raymond has recently discovered how to make a line that loops back,closes on itself, and makes a complete circle.  At first these circles just appeared as an unintended consequence of the circular movements of his hand as he drew.  Today he makes one of these \"accidental\" circles, pauses, looks carefully at it as if it is not just another mark.  Then he makes, in a more deliberate manner, a large circle in a space on the paper by itself.  This time he really smiles.  Then he takes his pencil and rubs it quickly  in short strokes inside the circle. He makes another patch inside the circle.  He make no such patches outside the circle.  He holds his paper up to his father and says, \"Look.\"','We would be over interpreting Raymond\'s work to say that he was drawing a face or a ball or any other symbolic referent.  But he has clearly recognized that a closed loop creates two types of spaces with very different status and priviledge.  The circle has an inside, in which things like the patches can reside, and an outside that is more diffuse, vacant and background.  This basic figure/ground distinction, inside an element vs outside an element, is the foundation of graphic symbolization.  Raymond will continue to draw more circles and they will become the armature upon which he will attach all sorts of symbolic modifiers.','Look for occassions when #first# draws a circle and then notice how that circle is used as a core for more features or as a model for other circles.\n\n#first# draws a circle, inspects it, and then draws three more in new spaces\n#first# draws a circle then make new marks on its edge and no where else\n#first# draws a circle and shades the entire circle careful not to go outside\n#first# draws a circle and then makes another circle that is much flatter\n','Once #first# has discovered the magic of a closed looped in #his/her# drawing, the drawing will take on new meaning.

Your teachable moment comes when #first# makes loops and circles in a deliberate manner and either pauses quietly or tries to share this new element with you.  Somewhere between \"That\'s nice.\" and \"Is that a person\" is the correct response.  The first comment is too general and the second too specific.  In the early stages perhaps the best response is simply to draw attention to the special features of a closed loop, that is, the fact that it is closed.  \"You made the line loop back and touch itself.\" would be appropriate.

Children experiment with different colors  trying out different contrasts.  Young children are not concerned with realistic color use or color to \"create a mood\" as older artists are (Gardner, 1980; Lark Horovitz, 1976). According to Winner (1982), it is not uncommon for children to paint purple people, green suns, and red grass.  According to Lark Horovitz (1976), until children are about five years old, they tend to view color as an entity onto itself rather than merely an attribute of something that they are depicting.  Young children tend to have favorite colors and may use that color repeatedly for long periods of time (Lark Horovitz, 1976).  Once youngsters start to work with paints or markers, they may explore the mixing of colors.  When they find that mixing of the colors leads to murkiness, rather than the vivid, bright colors that preschoolers tend to prefer, they begin to explore ways to use different colors and yet preserve each.  Children\'s approaches to color varies, some children attaching more importance to it while others experiment more with texture and line.  Parent may notice children testing out different textures by using their crayons sideways or holding a brush at an angle and using more or less paint.  Similarly, children may experiment with different lines and forms (See VS/LW 24 Mos. #1). \n\nWhat about color preferences?  Some research suggested that young children tend to be attracted to bright, primary colors while older children prefer more subtle colors (Subes, 1959, as cited in Lark Horovitz & Lewis, 1976).  Other research indicates that both infants and adults tend to prefer color centers, rather than boundaries or mixes (Bornstein, 1978).  For example, a pure blue would be preferred over a green blue.  Also, infants and adults show a preference for colors at the extreme of the spectrum, rather than at the middle.  For example, Bornstein (1975) found that as early as four months of age, infants attended more to pure colors and they most preferred blue and red, the extremes of the spectrum.  This preference for blue and red is seen also in kindergartners, who found blue and red more pleasant than yellow and green (Dashiell, 1917, as cited in Bornstein, 1978), as well as in children 7 , 9 , and 11 years old, who prefer red more than blue and blue more than green.

Another noteworthy aspect of Franny\'s work was the way she confined these experiments to the production of definite, similar elements.  The discovery of the green bulb did not excite her to mix yellow and blue anywhere as a younger child might.

These scribbles have the pattern and flow of writing and often are intended to communicate meaning (Cowie, 1989).   This does not mean, however, that children understand that there are specific sound/symbol relationships, nor do they understand the letter/word distinction, rather than they understand that a certain \"class of marks corresponds to words\" (Clay, 1975; Gardner, 1980, pg. 155.) \n\nDuring various types of play, children of this age may create a mark or marks which are meant to represent something or communicate some meaning.  For example, while playing \"grocery store\" a child of this age may create a grocery list using scribble writing.  These writing marks differ from children\'s drawing forms, as they typically look like linear scribble, with an up and down flow and proceeding from right to left across the page (Goodman, 1986; Sumsion, 1991).  The scribble writing of children this age can include squiggle marks, \"small controlled shapes that resemble letters\" and perhaps even some \"random conventional letters or numerals\" (Sumsion, 1991). \n\nBecause this scribble writing is often meant to communicate a message, children may present their scribble writing to an observer and read their message, saying, \"this says...\" (Goodman, 1986).   Case studies suggest that children will experiment with \"writing\" without being taught and that it will begin to appear spontaneously in their dramatic play and drawings (Bissex, 1980; Newman & Roskos, 1989).  Three and four year olds can often \"tell the story\" of their writing, however they will look off into the distance and ignore their scribble writing completely, as they lack an understanding of the letter  to  spoken sound relationship (Newman, 1984; Sumsion, 1991). \n\nBy the time children are in elementary school, they differentiate between words and drawing, demonstrating knowledge and use of print features, some letter formations and sound/symbol correspondence (Cowie, 1989; Gardner, 1980; Newman & Roskos, 1989). As childrens\' understanding of the relationship between the written letter and spoken sound increases, so too does their interest in the formation of conventional letters and words. Most often, the first letters children tend to recognize and write are the ones in their name (Sumsion, 1991).\n',NULL,NULL,'Rita has a friend Dedre and they love to pretend they are sending letters to each other.

It is believed to derive from a circle  considered the easiest form to make.  Some researchers, (Kellogg, 1970) suggest that the tadpole form emerges naturally as children are scribbling.  These figures usually emerge around age three.  Researchers disagree about why children draw tadpole figures.  Some researchers believe that it reflects the child\'s mental image of the body  that the torso is not significant (Cox & Parkin, 1986) while others believe that children leave out the torso simply because of the production demands that drawing it makes on memory (Freeman, 1975; 1980).  Other researchers suggest that it is included and is just not segmented (Paget, 1932; Arnheim, 1975).  (For a complete discussion, see Cox, 1989.)  Researcher Maureen Cox points out that children may not mean the same thing by their tadpole drawings.  In asking children about their drawings, many of them indicated that the tadpole circle included the body or that the body was hard to draw.  The children did recognize that the head and body were two different parts of the human figure.  Eventually (for some children  around age 4 or even earlier) , children start adding limbs to their tadpoles in ways that give a greater indication of a body.\n\nBetween the stages when children draw tadpole figures and conventional figures, they often go through a stage when they draw transitional figures.  These are figures that have body features such as arms, button, and a navel  but these are often drawn on the lower part of the figure even though there may not be a distinct head and body.  There is only one closed contour.

Is this a person?\"  Harry nods his head yes.  \"Well,\" his mother continues, \"I am confused.  Where would you put his belly button.  I think your person would look great with a belly button.\"  \"O.K.\" Harry agrees and makes a rather dark dot just at the bottom of his circle, but clearly inside what heretofore looked like the entire head. ','Without the question from Harry\'s mother we would not know what the circle meant to Harry.  But when he placed the belly button inside the circle it is plausible to assume that this large circle represents both the drawn person\'s head and the body.   That is to say, Harry had not forgotten the body in his drawing; rather he blended the contour of the body with the contour of the head.  If he had placed the belly button outside the circle, say between the two tooth pick legs, then we would conclude that the circle was exclusively the person\'s head.','#first# may draw blended parts in a variety of situations or may learn to distinguish them in others.\n\n• #first# insists that he has drawn several rooms inside his house but the drawing is itself a single, undivided circle\n• #first# draws a single line and says that the top part of his line represents the \"branches\"\n• #first# draws #his/her# pet cat as a circle and then a smaller, overlapping circle that is a mouse that the cat has caught. \n','When #first# first begins to draw figures of people and other familiar objects #he/she# no doubt will blend some features that should be differentiated, such as the head versus the torso.

However, it is not until about age four, that children can anticipate the sequence of landmarks that they can see when traveling the reverse route.  [This relates to dynamic imagery.  See VS LW #2, 42 Mos.]  Researchers (Hazen, Lockman, & Pick, 1978) tested children\'s ability to construct an understanding of a space with either four or six rooms.  They asked children to reverse the route that they had traveled between the rooms, to tell what order they expected to see landmarks (stuffed animals that were propped up in certain places) that they had seen previously now that the route was reversed, and to predict what was on the other sides of the walls based upon what they could have learned from their walk through the space.  Research on how children negotiate large scale environments suggests that children\'s learning progresses from remembering particular routes to having more integrated, map like representations.  Children are believed to progress from having fragmented pieces of routes in their minds that then are linked to create broader, integrated understandings.  It wasn\'t until about age six that children could predict what was on the other side of a door that they had not traveled through but had enough information to construct where they were and what was on the other side. The ability to talk about the reversals came after the ability to perform them. \n\nAn important finding in the research on children\'s understanding of spatial lay outs is that the quality rather than the quantity of exposure is important.  When children explore an environment actively as opposed to passively, they are able to construct a more accurate representation of the space (Hazen, 1982).  (This has also been show to be true for animals (Held, 1965; Held & Hein, 1963)).  Repeated exposure to a space was found to be less important than active participation in constructing a model (Herman & Siegel, 1978).  Feldman and Acredolo (1979) compared children who walked by themselves to a certain location and those who were led by a parent.  The first group of children did a better job remembering the place than children who were guided by a parent.  It may be that active exploration helps children to focus more on relevant landmarks (Feldman & Acredolo, 1979). \n','Vicky Goes the Long Way Round','Finding an object by using a set of remembered actions','Vicky was chasing her puppy from one room to the other in her house.

Do not expect too much at this stage, but rest assured that these questions will give #first# a disposition to think about large scale space.','Where\'s the car','Finding a way back to where you started','You and #first# are trying to find your way among the tables at a large outdoor fleamarket (or some other situation where there are many similar objects, like bolders along a mountain area or tables at a town picnic or cars in a large shopping complex parking lot).  You continually walk away from your car but agree to check where you are every once and a while so you can find your way back to the car.  Once you have finished your business, you now must return to your car.','You begin with a question something like this, \"Now lets see.  Where is the car?\"  See if #first# can point to the general direction of the car from where you are standing.  This game assumes that the situation is such that you can not actually see the car in the distance at this point, or it is not at all obvious as a distinct object.  ','Do not expect too much if the space is rather large and complicated.  This little game works best when your are in a space, say, the size of a public cafeteria or library and you are asking #first# if he remembers the door that you entered.  It works even better if you set this game up with advanced warning that you would like #his/her# help to find your way out after you finish your business. ','At some point #first# will be able to figure out a return path even when #he/she# has not actually walked that path in question.

You notice that when you get to the bottom of the escalator #he/she# can go directly to the Disney store around the corner that #he/she# saw from the mazanine but can not see from where #he/she# is now.  ','If you ask #first# to think about how #he/she# got to a point then #first# can invent some sort of spatial \"log\" that #he/she# can use when it is time to construct the return path.

Say #first# has left a prized teddy at the base of a tree.  Then #he/she# runs around the yard at play.  #first# asks you where is the teddy.','You explain to #first# that teddy is at the base of one of the trees in the yard but you can not remember which one.

Occasionally ask #first# a question such as, \"Was it in the front yard or the back yard?\"  Change the specifics of this idea to fit your own neighborhood.','If #first# is very frustrated, then give more clues.  \"I think the tree was in the front yard\" or \"Remember, teddy was near where you keep your tricycle.\"  These clues should reduce the number of places that the teddy could be, that is, the clues specifies x not y (front yard, not back yard).   Try not to give cues with your body, such as glancing to the target site or walking in that direction.  Let #first# do the looking and leaning.','If you sense that #first# likes this game of finding teddy, then add a few rules.  You and #first# can put teddy next to a bush or (if indoors) a chair, someplace where the spot is not \"marked\" with a one of a kind object.  This makes it necessary for #first# to remember a spatial location rather than just to look out over the room for the unique object that marks the place where teddy rests.  Once you have found a suitable place, then ask #first# to walk a fairly long distance with #his/her# eyes closed.  You can hold #his/her# hand.  Then turn #him/her #aroung about a three quarter turn.  Let #him/her# at that point open #his/her# eyes and look for teddy.  ','To find the teddy bear, particularly in this last version of the game, #first# will have to view the total area and orient #himself/herself# to that space in order to go directly to the teddy.  Given that there are several objects that look like the one that marks the target location, #first# has to use spatial layout (near - far, right - left, back - front) to locate the coveted toy.  In other words, if you have set up the situation well, #first# can not simply retrace #his/her# steps in a reversed sequence to find the teddy.  ##he/she## has to have a sort of \"cognitive map\" of the whole space.

They experiment with rolling it into balls, snakes, and making pancake shapes.  Research by Claire Golomb (1974; 1989) shows that between 2.4 and 7.4 years of age and often around age three, children begin to explore at least three different types of clay models.  They are quite different in style and children appear to discover them independently from each other.  The most common is an upright standing column.  This is a blob of modeling dough that has been lengthened and shaped so that it can stand upright.  While the details of the figure are rough, Golomb\'s research shows that children often can tell you which parts are the legs, arms, and so forth.  The second model is fairly common.  It exists of a ball or flattened blob of playdough and has a face etched into it.  The child may opportunistically use indentations and spots in the playdough as facial features.  The third type of model identified by Golomb is less common.  It is comprised of facial features created out of pieces of clay and arranged on a surface so that the pieces make up a face.  As children gain more practice, they often add arms and legs onto the playdough head of the second model and create a creature that resembles their tadpole drawings.  [See VS LW  33 Months-Tadpole Drawings.]   Often in these early stages, children neglect to create the back of 3 d figures, and truly 3 d work is rare.  However, Golomb gives examples to suggest that children are aware of it and will attend to the back when doing featureless pieces such as a cup. ','Kevin Makes a Brush of Clay','Changing focus from pressing down to drawing up','Kevin is busily pounding his clay in preparation for making something with it.  He pounds it flat with straight punches of his fist.  After the last pound he raises his knuckled fist only to notice four finger indentation in the clay.  He places a gentle finger tip into the indentation made by one of his fingers.  Then he shifts his focus from the indentation and starts to pinch on the clay ridges made by the space between his fingers.  He draws this ridge higher, working his pinching along the entire length of the clay.  He repeats this action to the two other ridges, yielding a formation that looks something like a hair brush  with an exaggerated vacancy between each row.  But this resemblance is enough for Kevin.  He smiles, lifts the \"brush\" toward his hair, and without mating his real hair to  clay brush, pretends to groom his hair. ','Kevin has noticed something new about clay.  Not only can he shape clay into total shapes (circles versus sausages), he can also create pertuberances and textures within the planar surface of the clay.  This revelation was catalyzed by the small ridges fortuitously made by a single action of his fist.  But then he turned round on this accident and invented a new way to enhance the ridges.  That is, he did not simply pound the indentations again; rather he invented a pinching action that brought the ridges out through a more direct application of pressure.   His reframing an effect (the ridge) into a means of creating the effect (the pinch) is a mark of high level thinking.  This statement says nothing, but should, of his shift from thinking about the indentations made by pounding to the ridges made by pounding.  All on top of all of this, Keven recognizes, perhaps only after the clay was shaped, that he has made a fairly good rendering of a hair brush.  At this point the instrumental action of building shifts to the symbolic actions of pretending while at the same time honoring the physical nature of the clay that might get matted in his hair.

Once you see something new, you can call #first#\'s attention to both the action and the result of that new technique.  \"When you pinch the clay it makes little ridges.\"  Find words that you believe #first# already understands.  Perhaps, \"When you poke the clay, it makes small holes\" is better than \"When you poke the clay it makes small indentations.\"  But do not be afraid to use new words, particularly if you sense that #first# enjoys new words.  Teachable moments occur whenever you see #first# pause in a reflective minute and you have a sense of what the wonder is about.  A smile to confirm the discovery could be enough; a comment to give definition to the event could be the most.','Clay Play ',NULL,'Provide #first# with some high quality clay or plasticine.

On the other hand #first# might be making clay symbols for real objects.  Let\'s presume that #first# has moved from exploring the physical properties of the clay to making shapes that look like real objects.  Perhaps #first# is making flattened circles and calling them \"pancakes\" and pretends to eat them.  Or perhaps #first# has made a long sausage shape and calls it a \"snake\" or \"worm.\"','Pick up on the theme and expand it.

In this fashion first will begin to intergrate the action with the resultant shape.','As #first# becomes more skilled in making things with clay, you can become more systematic in your support.  For example, ask #first# to make as many different \"clay elements\" in advance, elements that #he/she# can use later in the construction of clay symbols.  For example,  encourage #him/her# to make three or four of the following: tiny balls, stings of clay at different lenghts, pancakes, closed loops, half circles, anything that you think can be added to a base of clay to give the symbol more detail.  Think about the object that #first# likes to make and then work these tiny elements toward that end.  For example, if #first# like to make cats, then help #him/her# make elements that could be details on the cat, triangular shapes for ears, string lengths for whiskers, pointed shapes for claws.  ','These various encounters will help #first# make the shift from action on the clay for action\'s sake, to action in order to yield a particular product.  The encounters that focus on clay elements will help #first# think about an \"alphabet\" of small shapes that can be combined in new ways to make new shapes.  These elements also help #first# begin to analysize a whole object into its fundamental untis.  Thus what #first# is really learning while working in clay is the dual relation between analysis of a whole into fundamental and repeated parts as well as the synthesis and recombination of these elements into new and invented wholes. ','The Snowman\'s Back','Orienting #first# to the third dimension of clay figures  ','You have noticed that #first# enjoys working with clay and that #his/her# work has taken on a new dimension, the third dimension.  That is, the clay object is more than a flattened shape such as made by a cookie cutter.  The objects are beginning to have height, which also means that they can have a front, back, and side - in addtion to a top.  Perhaps you have also noticed that these objects have much more attention paid to their fronts than to their backs.  ','It is not important to press or rush #first# into making more complete representations.  It is o.k. for #him/her# to work for many months without paying much attention to the back.

How can I know which side is the back?\"   If #first# has already placed marks for the eyes and nose, you question could be changed to \"Does a snow man have anything, anything at all, that is in the back.\"  ','You could make a clay figure similar to what you see #first# making.  Without calling attention to your snowman (or whatever #first# is making) add some features to a side (right, left, or back) that #first# has ignored.

Do not ask #first# to make a snowman like yours.  Let #first# either pick up on the idea or not without any specific guidance from you.  Do not be disappointed if #first# ignores your work.

According to the research of Lila Ghent Braine, if the focal point of a pattern is in the upper half of a design, then children consider it to be right side up.  This is so even when adult standards of what it the top differ.  Research on children\'s processing of shapes and designs indicates that children of this age process objects in a downward fashion, beginning with a focal point and moving downward direction (Braine, 1973, p.46).  Therefore, when a pattern or object has a focal point at the upper half of an object, children of this age consider it right side up, as it is in accord with their focal point downward system of visual processing.  When a pattern is oriented so that the focal feature is at the bottom, it is in conflict with the natural processing system of children of this age, and is therefore considered upside down, regardless of its true orientation (Braine, 1973, p.46). The children in the research study reoriented designs to put them \"right side up\" in copying them.  When given a figure to copy, the children in Braine\'s research study rotated geometric designs when the design had a focal point at the bottom, but did not rotate the design if the focal point was at the top (Braine, 1973, p.47, 50).  \n \nBraine, L.

This geometric design, which dominates that page, deliberately elicits slight tension in the viewer, given it\'s unstable, top heavy appearance.   Tanya pauses on this page, then turns the advertisement upside down.  She looks at the design for a moment.  Then her eyes wander to the adjacent page and she turns the magazine right side up.','Even though the logo has no pictorial value, that is, it does not represent a familiar object, Tanya responds to this geometric sahpe as if it were upside down.  The power of this design to elicit an uneasy feeling in Tanya needs to be explained.   That power has its source in Tanya\'s learning some rather general rules about visual and physical balance.   The two triangles are treated as separate objects, something like two blocks, and Tanya realizes this structure would be unstable.  To compensate, she rotates the page the other way,inverting the logo, and reducing her feeling about its instability.  However, when she visually steps back and notices the other page, she realizes that now the text and photographs on that page are upside down.  Her final choice is to allow the abstract design to look upside down (rotates the magazine right side up), given that she is more certain about the orientation of the pictures and text.

Tilt the drawing back the \"uncomfortable\" way to see if #first# will once again turn it to his preferred orientation.  If you get a fairly good sense what drives #first#\'s preference, then venture a casual comment.  \"Oh, that way the point is on the top.\"   If the drawing is representational, e.g. a house, then when #first# turns it right side up, it only means that #first# has some memory for how this object is usually placed.

Some have pieces that fit in self-contained spaces, like reinserting cookie dough in the hole made by the cutter.  Others have an board in which one has to place several pieces, before other pieces have a hole at all.  Within this second category, some puzzles have pieces that are cut-outs of recognizable objects, like a whole pumpkin, cow, or tractor in a farm scene.  Others in this category have pieces that are cut across recognizable objects so that it make take three random pieces to reassemble a single pumpkin.  This last type of puzzle is more difficult.

Notice how #first# knows which way a single piece should be oriented.  When #he/she# knows to upright a piece it makes it easier to find the correct space for the piece.  ','If #first# is persistently trying to place a piece that has no hole, you can gently say to the air around the two of you, \"I wonder if another piece would fit.\"  Do not say, \"Sweetheart, why don\'t you try another piece?\"  At this age, direct suggestions provoke resistance.  If #first# does not change #his/her# strategy, rest assured that #he/she# has still thought about your suggestion.  It will in fact be easier for #him/her# to apply your suggestion if you do not mention this strategy again for a while.  On other occasions, you might make comments that are a hint about the nature of a problem (\"That\'s a very big piece\"; \"Those two pieces are very much alike, but not quite\"), or as a summary about a recent placement (\"The color is the same between those two pieces\"; \"You placed the pig next to the corn\").','Jigsaw puzzles with random cuts are the most challenging type.  Notice the strategies that #first# uses to solve this type of puzzles.  Some children hold onto a piece and search everywhere for a hole.  Others find a hole in the board and then go through an assortment of different pieces trying each in the same hole.  With the random cuts puzzle, this latter strategy has a better payoff.

Jigsaw puzzles also allow #first# to invent strategies that increase #his/her# probability of success, such as placing similar pieces together, looking for pieces that have well defined holes first, learning to rotate a piece several times before giving up on a hole.

These tasks involve being able to judge what objects, places, and people would look like if they changed position or shape.  Early research showed that children had quite a bit of difficulty with the tasks involved in dynamic imagery (e.g. Piaget & Inhelder, 1971).  This is not surprising considering that it involves generating an image, holding it in one\'s working memory, scanning it, and transforming it with regard to the specific change (Kosslyn, Margolis, Barret, & Goldknof, 1990).  However, more recent research has helped to reveal some of children\'s developing competencies in dynamic imagery and it suggests that there are some understandings that children can demonstrate by the time that they are three and a half years old.  Researchers (Reiser, Garing & Young, 1994) have found that by around three and a half, children can imagine their classrooms and point to where certain object would be from the perspective of their teacher\'s seat or from their own seats.  Their long term knowledge is not limited to a certain viewpoint and even if they have experience with one viewpoint, they can tell you some things about the opposite viewpoint.  (Some earlier studies asked children to imagine objects rather than surroundings and children were less successful (e.g. Dean, Duhe, & Green, 1983; Kerr, Corbitt, & Jurkovic, 1980; Marmor, 1975).)  However, if children were asked to shift from one perspective to another in their imaginations, they ran into difficulty unless they physically walked to the new position to help them shift their perspective.  (It didn\'t help to engage in movements that were irrelevant to the perspective task, they needed to engage in relevant movements.)  Researchers (Reiser, Garing & Young, 1994) suggest that while walking, children were able to perceive the surroundings that they were trying to imagine in relation to the movements and that children can imagine a change in perspective if it corresponds to their physical actions.  Not until children were much older, were they able to imagine the shift entirely in their heads (some 9 year olds were successful.)',NULL,NULL,'Lenny was watching his mother dice vegetables for the family\'s favorite soup.

','The Rotating Train Tunnel','Dealing with hidden rotations of objects',' Sometimes you can slip in a simple challenge during the run of ordinary play.  In this case, suppose that #first# is playing with three connected train cars on a toy track - engine, flatcar, and caboose.  You quickly make a tunnel for the train by folding a piece of cardboard into a long tent.  Place the tunnel over the track so first can push the train through.  The tunnel will create spontaneous interest.   Make sure that the track is discounted at the beginning and end of the tunnel.  The reason for this will be apparent in the next section.','As #first# moves the train into the tunnel make up some excuse for the train to stop.  \"Oh, the tunnel has to turn.  It\'s 12 o\'clock and the tunnel always turns at twelve.\"  Turn the tunnel 180 degrees.  Then ask #first# to tell you which car will come out of the tunnel first as you continue on your journey.','Perhaps rotating the tunnel presents too much of a challenge.  You could stage a situation where #first# has to think about another person\'s view, without having to deal with an actual object rotation.  For example, use the view of the train platform worker, say, the man who will get the mail off the train.  Show #first# that the door to the mail car is on only one side of the mail car, say the door that faces the outside of the oval track.  When the train is on the opposite side of the oval from where #first# is sitting, that is when #he/she# can not see the door, ask #first# to tell you where to place the mailman figure.','A more complicated variation of the mailman game would be to ask #first# to predict where the door will be when the train makes its trip to the other side of the oval track.  This question can be asked as follows.  When the train is on the frontmost span of the oval, frontmost to #first#, ask #him/herk# to place the mailman doll on the opposite span where #he/she# thinks the door to the mail car will be.    #first# will see the door facing the \"bottom\" of the oval track, but when the train makes iillt trip around the oval to the other side, the door will be facing the \"top\" of the oval track.  You will have to think about the specific set up to determine if #first# is inventing ways to avoid thinking about these transformations, such as changing his own location before he answers.','These little games, in a brief but significant way, engage #first# to think about changes in spatial orientation.  Dealing with the dynamics of rotations, loopings,  and simple translocations is an everyday occurrence.  The child who can anticipate where things will be as the result of a particular type of movement will be in a better position to adapt and accommodate to those changes.  Anticipating where objects will be or how a scene will look in the next few minutes gives the child more time to make adjustments for those changes or to even avoid harmful consequences of being in the wrong place once the changes have happened.','Books on the Other Side','Predicting How to Get What','A number of situations in everyday life require #first# to deal with a reversal in some object\'s position.  In these situations, to be successful, #first# has to mentally transform that object into the new orientation in order to predict what will happen.  For example, if #first# is riding a bike with a toy fishing rod extending out the right side, he needs to predict that the rod will hit the mail box, now on his left,  once he negotiates the turn to come up the sidewalk from the other direction.   Can you think of situations where this condition occurs, where #first# needs to think ahead and predict what will happen after something has been rotated or otherwise reoriented.\nSuch a situation could occur with #his/her# whole body or with small scale objects.  Lets consider a case where a set of picture books rest on a large table, #first# wants one, can not reach it from #his/her# side, and has to go around to the other side.\n','As long as #first# can maintain visual contact with the one book that #he/she# wants, the situation does not present a challenge or a need to make a mental rotation.  By adding one condition you can increase the educational value of this situation.  Cover the books with a thick cloth, bunched to conceal the contour of the books.  Now ask #first# to find the catapillar book (or what ever it was) under the cloth.  Since #first# has to walk around to the other side, #he/she# can not use #his/her# own body (e.g. near this hand here) as a guide.  #first# will have to \"translate\" that cue into a new cue by performing the mental rotation of the whole set of books.   Notice which side of the cloth #first# searches under first.','There could be other situations that are more manageable than the game described above.  What if #first# is playing with a toy train on an oval track.  There is a  mineature village inside and outside the track.  On the outside of the track there is a mailbag hook, where a tiny little mail bag can be placed as the train moves pass.  As the train circles around, heading North on the right side of the oval (counterclockwise) ask #first# where #he/she# should place the little man with his arm sticking out so he can hook the mailbag on the mailhook.  The mailhook is outside the oval on the left side (i.e. at 9 o\'clock).    In other words, the mailbag will have to extend to the right side of the Northbound train so that it will be on the right side (from #first#\'s perspective) after it rounds the oval and turns South.  ','As #first# gains ability to immagine transformations you can set up situations that require the reversal of a reversal.  For example, if #first# was looking for the book under the cloth, ask #him/her# to close #his/her# eyes and the lead him to the other side of the table counterclockwise, pause, and then lead him all around the whole table clockwise to that same spot.  Can #first# deal with the double transformation.  Or with the mailbag game, could first predict where to place the little person with the extended arm if the both the train changed position and the mailhook was to be changed as well, from outside the oval to inside the oval.  Of course, these variations should be done in the flow of spontaneous play whenever possible.','#first# will develop a dispostion to think about the structure of change by playing these games.   Thinking about which position results from what movement can prepare #first# to solve a large number of spatial problems.   So often a spatial relation is misunderstood because the child fails to consider the moves that created that spatial relation.  It is this integration of movement and position that is so critical for general visual/spatial abilities.

Harriet Johnson defined seven stages in block building (ref.).  At around this time in development, children pass through Johnson\'s third and fourth stages.  [See LW VS 30 Months for a description of the first two stages.] At the third stage, children begin to create structures by bridging with the blocks (Guanella, 1934, pp 89 90; Johnson, 1932, pp.12, 19, 24).  Often this amounts to standing two or more blocks up on end spaced apart and connecting them with a third block across the top.  At the fourth stage, children begin to create enclosures with the blocks (Guanella, 1934, pp 89 90; Johnson, 1932, pp.12, 19, 24).  Their structures now have an inside and an outside and they may use the inside to place other toys.  Research suggests that children begin creating walls, surfaces, and floors by combining block building techniques shortly after the age of three (Johnson, 1932, p.11). This occurs as the child discovers that by combining building techniques and constructions, new forms are created, such as the formation of a wall from a series of towers.  Soon after this, they begin to incorporate  enclosures such as arches or bridges in their block play and building strategies which leads to the creations of structures that create interior spaces.  These developmental advances enable children to explore a variety of topological relationships.  They explore spatial relationships such as inside, outside, between, under, over and so on (Reifel, 1984, p.62).\n\nAt Johnson\'s fifth stage, as children grow older and have more experience with blocks, they begin to create decorative patterns in their structures. These often have repeating, symmetrical patterns (Forman, 1982, p.125; Johnson, 1932, p.11).  At the sixth stage, children begin to name their structures and may use them as part of dramatic play (Guanella, 1934, p.89).  At the seventh stage, children\'s block buildings represent actual structures that they know, for instance they may create a Bat Cave and park Batman\'s car in it.  They often use the structures in their dramatic play (Guanella, 1934, p.89; Reifel, 1984, p.62).\n',NULL,NULL,'Lori sits building with a set of wooden blocks.  She has two little ponies mixed in with her blocks and starts to make a path for them to walk on.  Then she decides to make an enclosure for them.  At first she just stands the ponies together and places two blocks very close to their sides and then jams two capping blocks on each end.  When she draws back to look at this she decides against the result  She spreads the long blocks further apart to give more room to the ponies.  Now her end pieces are too short so she exchanges them for longer one, completing an enclosure with fairly equal sides.  But now she wants a door out.  She removes one of the long end blocks and builds an arch with three blocks.  As she pretend walks one pony out the arch it knocks the lintel block off.  She think for awhile, then takes two short pieces to make a end to the corral, but this time with a gap between the two short pieces.  Then she constructs the arch on top of the gapping end pieces, and thereby makes a gateway arch that is taller than before.  She marches both of her ponies out the arch, back in, and out with a great sense of pride.','Building an enclosure requires a great deal of planning in order to leave the vacant space inside and to find the matching lengths of blocks arranged in parallel.  Notice that Lori first used the physical resistance of the ponies themselves to define the inside space.  She jammed the blocks against the ponies.  Then she formulated a conceptual space in her mind and built it according to her plan.  She even figured out how to raise the height of the inside of her arch by building the upright columns on top of the two short blocks.  Here again Lenny was thinking about the amount of open, vacant space that was needed for the ponies to go cleanly under the cross member of the arch.','The construction of vacant spaces, such as enclosures and arches, can be motivated by a variety of situations.\n\n• #first# wants to make a set of rooms for people toys in the blocks area\n• #first# wants to make a bridge over a pretend river made from a strip of blue paper.\n• #first# wants to make a ceiling to shelter a set of toy figures for the pretend rain\n• #first# wants to make a long garage for a bus.\n• #first# wants to make a closed pen so the toy animals can not escape\n','At some point #first# will not only make vacant spaces with blocks as an accidental structure, but will take great care to leave a gap.  The care means that the vacant space, the nothingness, has a somethingness about it.  #first# treats the hole as a definite element in the block structure, a window, door, or secret cave.  Wait until you see such a deliberate construction of vacant space and then see if you can extend the value of that vacant space.  For example, if #first# has made a doorway by constructing a three block arch, would #he/she# accept your adding a door, a rectangular block that opens and closes.  Expanding the meaning of vacant space, i.e. something that can be closed or open, can be an important step in the development of spatial thinking. ','Two Blocks Support Each Other','Discovering the difference between convenient and necessary relations','You have noticed that #first# has begun to make block structures that contain definite vacant spaces.  These may take the form of gaps between two blocks to serve as a door, four block enclosures to hold smaller objects, and arches through which smaller objects can pass.  The vacant spaces are actually used in some specific way.  That is how you know that the vacant space has a definite role in #first#\'s symbolic play.   In the encounter that follow, you will try to enrich the status and complexity of these vacant spaces.','Let say that you have seen #first#, on repeated occasions, make a three block arch.  This structure consists of two upright blocks spaced apart, with a third block, called the lintel, placed across the two ends of the upright blocks.  See if #first# can construct a two block arch by leaning two block into each other, creating a triangular shape with the floor.  Motivate the game by saying you would like this door to be built so your little person can walk \"through\" the door.  Build this structure on a non-slip surface, such as a carpet or table cloth.  Invite #first# to make one like yours, or \"accidentally\" knock your two block arch down and request that #first# put it back together again.   Remind yourself the \"through\" is a combination of \"under\" plus \"between.\"','Watch to see how persistant #first# is at trying to place the corners of the two rectangular blocks together.  That is the only why the structure can be built.  If #first# continually tries to place the flat top of one block under the flat side of the other, then it is clear that #first# has not discovered the physical necessity of using the reciprocal corners of both blocks.  At this point you can model, perhaps one more time, but be prepared to shift to a different activity.  For example, you can see if #first# can make a T-shaped structure that has at least an overhang for your person, even though the overhand does not define an enclosure.  That means that the T-shape structure at least allows for the little person to walk \"under\" but not \"between\" and by extension, not both \"between\" plus \"under.\"','As #first# learns to think about this structure, that each block is both supported by its neighbor while at the same time is supporting its neighbor, you will notice that #he/she# will persist at the one solution of placing each block against the corner of the other.  This persistence is a mark of #first# understanding of the necessary spatial relations, relations that are necessary in order to establish this mutual support and supported status of the two blocks leaning against each other.','The two block tower presents #first# with a conceptual problem.  Building this structure requires more than fine motor dextrity.  Even children with fine motor dextrity might not know to continually try to lean the two blocks at this most difficult point, the two facing corners.  In other words, this little encounter encourages #first# to think about the difference between convenient spatial relations (placing the flat surfaces together, which slip and always fall) versus necessary spatial relations (placing the pointed corners together, which sometimes falls, but is the only way to make the two block arch self supporting).

In the encounters that follow, you will try to enrich the status and complexity of these vacant spaces.','Lets say that #first# has only made single enclosures and all of these have been walled in enclosures in the horizontal plane, such as a pen for toy animals.  None of these enclosures have been subdivided into compartments.  Here is an opportunity for you to motivate the construction of subcompartments.  Once #first# has made #his/her# standard enclosure and used it for #his/her# usual reasons, say for the plastic cows in #his/her# toy animal collection, present #first# with a reason to subdivide the enclosure.  \"I think we need a special place to milk the cows.  I should not be where they eat.  We want to keep the milking place clean.  Could you make a special milking place inside your barn.\"  ','With this suggestion #first# might simply add a new enclosure elsewhere in the playing space.  But this construction does not exercise thinking about how to subdivid a larger space.  At this point, ask #first# if you can add a milking platform inside the barn.  If the answer is \"yes\" then place a floor of five or six long blocks to define the use of the barn into two different functions, a feeding area and the milking area.  See if #first# picks up on this idea and enhances it in any way, such as adding entry to the milking area or building a wall around the subarea for milking.','The idea of subdividing a larger space can be generalized to vertical enclosures as well.  For example, build one arch on top of two arches makes an interesting wall that has three \"windows\" two on the first row and one on the second row.  But even on the horizontal plane, subdivisions can become more complicated, such as a house divided into rooms and the rooms divided into closets and walking areas.  The scale of the blocks is very important for these more refined structures.  If the blocks are too bulky they do not lend themselves very well to nesting substructures inside super structures.','Thinking about nested spatial relations, such as a closet inside a room inside a house is itself a form of logic and well as a form of space.  It is believed that the construction with blocks helps children develop forms of thinking that are more organized and logical than thinking with only words.  The physical constraints of the blocks (solid, right angles, will fall if not balanced) help the child to re-invent ways of thinking that are the foundation of logic and math.  For example, in building a closet inside a room, one block is both the wall for the larger structure (the room) while it is also the wall for the smaller structure (the closet).  This \"reciprocity of role\" is an elementary form of what children have to learn in dealing with numbers, to wit, the number two is both bigger than the number one while at the same time is smaller than the number three.','2012-08-22 12:30:12','2012-08-22 12:30:12'),(2756,'v_48_1','Drawing Hidden Objects: Transparencies','What do children do when drawing one object that is partially hidden (or occluded) by another?  Or what if one object is inside another object?  This has been a topic of interest for a long time.  Very early research (Ricci, 1887) on children\'s drawing showed that they often created \"x ray\" drawings  meaning that you could see through the figure.  So for instance, children often draw figures so that the arms and legs show through the clothes.  Around age four, the drawing of transparencies begins to emerge and tends to be seen more between the ages of five and nine.  Young children might begin by drawing a body, but then attempt to draw the clothes over the top of the body (Goodenough & Tyler, 1959).  Transparencies are less common in spontaneous drawings (Cox, 1992) but when researchers asked children to draw people in skirts or coats, one third of the drawings were transparencies (Mann & Lehman, 1976).  Four year olds tended to create \"scribble transparencies\" where the person was drawn but there was clothes scribbled over the top.  Older children drew \"line by line\" and \"outline\" transparencies where the clothing was drawn in bolder lines over the body or drawn to follow the outline of the body.  Children tended to make excuses for these x ray drawings, suggesting that they recognized them to be inaccurate.  \n\nWhile some transparencies may be planning mistakes or result from how the child thinks about the things to be drawn, others may be intentional  such as when a child draws a normally hidden feature (Cox, 1992), such as a snake and what it has eaten inside it.  Maureen Cox (1992) suggests that how children think about what they are drawing influences whether or not they draw a transparency  helping to explain why sometimes children do create them while other times they don\'t.  According to Cox, while adults adopt a drawing rule of drawing the occluder first and then the object that is occluded, children are more likely to draw structural components first  leading to an accidental transparency.  She gives the example of children drawing a chair first and then the people who are seated in it.  Cox (1992) goes on to suggest that children would be more likely to be correct on a drawing where the occluder was structurally primary, such as that of a pin going through an apple as in an earlier study (Crook, 1985).  When asked to draw one object \"behind\" a similar object, before age 5, children draw them next to each other.  Not until they are around 8 years old do children show one object occluding another (Cox, 1992; Freeman, Eiser, & Sayers, 1977)  Noting that children as young as three do show the ability to interpret partially occluded pictures such as those found in story books (Hagen, 1976), Cox (1992) decided to investigate further.  Interestingly enough, she found that if the objects are different enough, such as a robber hiding behind a wall as in her study, nearly half of the four year olds depicted it correctly.   Children as young as five, omitted totally hidden objects from their drawings (Cox, 1992).\n',NULL,NULL,'Melanie has just finished drawing a fairly good rendering of a person standing full front.  She wants to show that this person is a clown so she adds big baggy clothes with oversized shoes.  Now she notices that one can see the body outline \"through\" the baggy clothes.

But the darker lines of the body contour still remain visible through the pale yellow covering.  With a slight sigh of resignation, Melanie explains, \"He\'s wearing a raincoat.\" which probably means a clear plastic coat.','Melanie may have known in advance that clothes would be a part of her drawing, but because she did not draw the clothes first, she was presented with the lines difficult to hide, the body contour lines.  But to Melanie it would not make much sense to draw clothes first.  Clothes need a body to put them on, so it makes more sense to draw the body first.  Children who know not to use the \"reasonable\" strategy have gone beyond the meaning of the drawing and take a purely technical stance toward the production of the drawing.  Yet even though Melanie could not marshal a plan to prevent the problem, she recognized the body lines as incongrous to the way things are in the real world.   So she tries to cover the lines with color.  When this does not work she at least give some reason why the transparency of the drawing could actually happen in the real world, i.e the plastic see through raincoat.','Transparences can occur in a variety of themes and for several reasons.\n\n• #first# might desire to show a transparency, such as the baby inside the pregnant mother, or a seed inside a flower blossom.\n• #first# is drawing, in profile, a cowboy on a horse and thinks it the drawing would look funny if the cowboy had only one leg (i.e.  #he/she# does not treat the one leg as a necessary consequence of point of view).\n• #first# did not really want to show a transparency, but because #he/she# draws the \"inside\" object first, the transparency results.\n','Drawing one object in front of another presents a special set of challenges.

Some early research suggested that children had difficulty creating models of their environments (Siegel & Schadler, 1977), however, later research suggests that this has to do with translating what is large scale into something small scale (Bluestein & Acredolo, 1979).  In order to find out more clearly what preschooler understand, researchers compared three kinds of tasks (Liben, Moore, & Goldbeck, 1982).  They took all of the furniture out of the nursery school room and asked children to reconstruct the lay out in full scale by showing where the furniture would go.  They also asked children to locate just certain pieces of furniture by leaving others in place.  Additionally, they asked children to construct a model representation of their classroom in small scale.  Children were most successful at placing furniture when there were already some pieces in place (suggesting that they use the topology of the space rather than Euclidean coordinates to guide their placement (Herman & Siegel, 1978; Liben, Moore, & Goldbeck, 1982).)  Children also were more successful at reconstructing their full scale classroom than creating a small scale model of it.  However, children\'s performance differed significantly from adults, suggesting that these are developing competencies and that while children are more capable than earlier research suggested, they grow in their ability to remember and locate objects in space over the coming years.  Whether or not children are successful depends a lot upon the details of the task  whether they are asked to switch views or perspectives (Schadler & Siegel, unpublished as cited in Siegel & White, 1975); translate scale; remember and place many items creating a memory load, and so forth.','The Slide goes Near the Swing','Trying to coordinate two distances at once','Sally and Rachael can not go outside today because of the rain.

The coordination of two distances to define a point is more difficult because it would require Sally or Rachael to consider the interception of two lines in space, indeed, in a space that has no physical landmark such as another piece of equipment or a physical edge.

However, the rate of growth can be quite individual and independent walking can range from 9 to 17 months of age.  According to Curtis (1982), \"Walking marks the emergence of children from infancy into the toddler phase.  It is a c¬hild\'s most remarkable motoric accomplishment.\"  Children do not become mature walkers until they are between 4 and 7 years old (Espenschade & Eckert, 1980; Grieve & Gaer, 1966; Wickstrom, 1977). \n\nWalking progresses through a number of phases.  Researchers (Gallahue, 1982 from an unpublished dissertation by Gad-Elmawla, 1980; Wickstrom, 1977) cite the following patterns as children move from initial to more mature forms of walking.  Initial walking is characterized by shorter, rigid steps, with toes turned outward and flat footed contact.  Children\'s knees bend as their foot touches the ground, then straightens quickly.  They have relatively no ankle movement.  Their legs are often bent excessively.  Their toes tend to point out and their feet are spread apart wide.  Their bodies have a slight forward lean with no hip rotation.   Immature walkers tend to lose their balance and fall more often and use their arms for balance so they tend to hold their arms up with their elbows bent for protection against falls (high-guard position).  As their gait matures, their dynamic base narrows quickly, high-guard arm position is abandoned, and heel-strike is usually present in walking form by age two years  (Wickstrom, 1977).  Eventually, their initial gait is replaced by a lengthening step, heel to toe contact, and straighter toes.  Mature walking is characterized by an increased step length, heel contacting the ground with the knee straight. The child\'s weight rolls forward so the toe pushes and then knee bends as it is lifted off the ground.  Toes generally point straight ahead.  Children place their feet closer together, narrowing the base of support.  Their forward lean decreases and there is hip rotation to the back to the support leg, then forward to the side of the moving leg.  Children hold their arms straight and often swing them at the sides of their bodies (Gallahue, 1982; Wickstrom, 1977).\n\nThe role of practice has been controversial in the onset of improved motor skills.  A classic study of Navajo babies who were strapped to cradle boards throughout most of their infancy found there was no delay in walking (Dennis, & Dennis, 1940).  Babies who were offered three minutes of practice in locomotion per day beginning at two weeks old did walk two months earlier than their counterparts who did not have practice (Zelazo, Zelazo, & Kolb, 1972).  The African Kipsigis encourage and early sitting (by placing the baby in a shallow hole in the earth), standing, and walking, which results in earlier locomotor onset (Super, 1976), but only in those skills practiced.  On the other hand, babies who are not given the special practice soon catch up to their trained counterparts.\n','Eloise walks on her own.',NULL,'Eloise has been able to stand free from any support for a little while. She is standing at the side of her highchair (which she used to pull herself to a standing position).  Eloise has a favorite small wheeled zebra which she likes to sit on, and it is about two feet from the side of the chair.  She lets go of the railing on the chair and after getting her balance, steps towards the zebra with out falling down.  ','Eloise is beginning to walk independently.  Like most skills, walking is a progression of small gains in skill (from immobility to successful independent walking).  As her skills have improved, so has her muscular control and her confidence.

The opposable use of the thumb tends to occur around 8 months of age, however, while children are then able to use the thumb as opposite their fingers, typically, they use their fingers as a unit so the object is grasped between them. By around nine and ten months of age, children begin to use an index finger approach which relies upon using the index finger to contact the object and then using the thumb as opposable to it. \n\n \nAs newborns, their grasp was reflexive.  Around three months they began to gain more voluntary control over it.  They could hold onto an object put into their hands and around four months, they could precariously grasp an object.  Now, they are able to use their palms to help them more securely grasp an object.  By five months, they were becoming more adept at grasping and maintaining objects, they begin to use their whole hand to more securely grasp objects and lift objects by pushing the objects with their fingers against their palms.  Around six months of age, children begin to use a whole hand or mitten grasp.  This means that they use their thumb separately as in using a mitten but not yet as opposable.  Around 7 months old, children often tend to use a scissors grasp where they pick up small objects by using a scissor motion with their hand and thumbs.\n  \nPicking object up is one feat, another is voluntarily letting objects go.  Infants become increasingly able to voluntarily release objects between the ages of 6 and 8 months of age.  While their release is still somewhat crude, it develops further in the coming months, particularly as they begin dropping experiments with their toys.

Voluntarily releasing an object when and as the child wants is an ability that children tend to master by about 14 months of age (Gallahue, 1982).  Children need to be able to control the flexor muscles in the fingers in order to voluntarily release a grasp.  While the fundamentals are available to children at 14 months, children don\'t tend to have a coordinated release until they are about 18 months of age (Halverson, 1937).  It\'s not that children haven\'t been practicing the release of objects.  Recall those dropping experiments that infants begin at around 5 or 6 months and continue with?  Being able to open one\'s fingers deliberately begins as early as six months and is further developed by the time the child is 12-15 months old.  This provides the opportunity to practice releasing a well as to see what happens.  Between 12-15 months of age, children tend to master the fundamentals of opening his fingers in order to deliberately drop an object (12   15 months) and by 15-18 months, they learn how to swing their arms in order to hurl an object some distance from themselves.  This latter action requires that the child open his fingers before the arm movement has completed but not before the arm begins to move.  These early actions are learned from a sitting position, on the floor or in a high chair, as every parent knows who has had to repeatedly retrieve the objects hurtled across the room. At three, the child has begun to experiment with throwing a ball while standing.   Throwing involves coordinating a lot of different information, such as the release of one\'s grasp with the right timing in relation to pulling the arm back and rotating the body as weight is shifted.  Because it involves the coordination of so many different body parts, the skill of throwing takes a long time to mature (Stewart, 1980).  Around ages two and three, children use mostly forearm extension but little footwork or rotation of their bodies (Zaichowsky, Zaichowsky, & Martinek, 1980).  Children pass through stages as they learn to bring more of their body into the coordinated set of actions involved in sending an object away (Wild, 1938).

Coming downstairs tends to be harder than going up and children will be more proficient at climbing than descending stairs.  Typically, they begin by stopping with both feet on each step (what researchers have referred to as \"marking time\") and by about age 4, they begin to use one foot on each step.  The one foot on each step pattern usually is seen first for going up and then for going down (Gallahue, 1982; Zaichowsky, Zaichowsky & Martinek, 1980).

Stacking objects is a big step because it requires hand eye coordination and spatial awareness.  Before children come to view blocks and block-like objects as stackable, they may carry them around with them rather than actually build with them. This helps them to refine their grasp.  It\'s not uncommon to see them banging two blocks together around 9 or 10 months of age. As children develop greater eye-hand coordination, they may come to view the objects as things to be stacked and knocked down.  While some children show great interest and spend long periods of time stacking up objects and knocking them down, others are not so interested.  This creates a great deal of variation in when children begin stacking objects.\n\n \nWhen it comes to more than stacking and knocking down objects and actually building with them instead, the timing depends upon when children first begin to encounter blocks and how much time they spend with them.  While children are capable of stacking objects as early as 10 to 18 months, often it is not until around 27 months of age, that children begin to build with blocks making piles by stacking blocks vertically on top of one another and making rows horizontally by placing blocks on a surface next to each other (Forman, 1982, p.113 114; Gesell, 1940, p. 222; Guanella, 1934, p. 89) in the sense of building something.  Research has shown that toddlers first tend to place blocks on one another before they place blocks next to one another (Forman, 1982, p.128; Gura, 1992, p.53).  With an increase in age there is an increase in the number of blocks with which children build and an increase in the amount of discrimination children use to select blocks with which to build (Forman, 1982, pp.109, 125; Johnson, 1933, p.24).  The placement of blocks on one another now leads to the building of towers and piles, and the placement of blocks by one another leads to the building of rows (Reifel, 1984, p.62).\n','Adam enjoys building towers.',NULL,'Adam and his mother Rosalind are sitting on the floor.

This toddlerish type of running is more a form of exaggerated walking than it is actual running.  Running evolves naturally from walking and children\'s early running attempts are rapid walking steps (Curtis, 1982).   Researchers who study running divide it up into different phases in terms of developmental maturity.  In some respects, running is like walking except that in mature running, there is a point of time when both feet are off the ground-a period of nonsupport when the body is airborne.  This is referred to as the flight phase and usually does not occur until around two (Gallahue, 1982) although some researchers suggest that you might see it\'s earliest forms at as early as eighteen months of age (Curtis, 1982).  Some researchers (Slocum & James, 1968) think of running as like a series of coordinated jumps.  This helps to suggest the leg strength that a child has to have in order to engage in \"true\" running (Stewart, 1980).\n\nThis early running or exaggerated walking has the following types of characteristics (e.g. Fenn, 1930; McClenaghan, 1976 reported by Gallahue, 1982; Stewart, 1980; Wickstrom, 1977). The swing of the leg is limited; the stride uneven and rigid; the support leg is not completely extended; arms swing outwardly; there is an outward turn to the swinging leg and foot, and there is a wide base of support. The forward foot strikes the ground far beyond the center of gravity.  There is very little knee-lift  and often there is more emphasis on upward than forward movement (a kind of bouncing.)  Even when children have mastered mature forms of walking, they may revert to less mature forms when first attempting to run (Burnett & Johnson, 1971).  For instance, they may become more flat-footed and widen their base of support (as reported in Stewart, 1980).  As their running ability matures, children increase their stride, arm swing, and speed, and there is a definite flight stage.\n','Wendy runs to chase a rolling ball.',NULL,'Wendy is playing a ball rolling game with her father, Tony.

This step requires that the child feels comfortable judging distance as well as coordinating his or her body to make the leap. There is a fair amount of variation in when children become able to jump with two feet.  The ability to jump down from objects develops before the ability to jump with both feet due to the muscle strength required to actually jump up and propel oneself into space (Hellebrandt et al., 1961).  Young children can often coordinate the crouch, flexion of the trunk, and body movements of a jump before they have gained enough strength to actually propel themselves into the air (as reported in Stewart, 1980).  \n\nHere are some mini-milestones that occur along the road to jumping for distance and height.  D. L Gallahue (1976) and R. L. Wickstrom (1977) report that by around 18 months, children master stepping down from low objects, by 24 months, they are learning to jumps down from low objects using both of their feet and to jumps off the floor from a standing position using both feet.  By around 37 months, children begin to refine this jump and jumps from low object with their arms back when leaping and can typically  remain standing when they land.  By 40 months of age, children are refining their jumping skills considerably.  Now they can jumps a short distance, using their arms to help gain distance, crouching low before extending their legs, leaning forward and leaping with arms back.  They land with arms forward to provide greater stability. \n','Amy steps down from a low rock by herself.',NULL,'Amy is on a walk with her mother Candace.

Kicking is the act of imparting force to an object with the foot.  According to Gesell (1940), shortly after children are able to run, they are able to kick.  Roberts and Metcalfe (1968) have found that participation of pelvic rotation in the kick over and above that used in running appears to develop as early as at 2 years of age.  Gallahue (1982) defines a set of stages through which children progress in mastering kicking that are based on the extensive research of Deach (1951), Seefeldt and Haubenstricker (1981), and McClenaghan (1976).  In the initial stages of mastery, children tend to kick at the ball rather than kicking it squarely and following the movement through.  They keep their trunks erect and use their arms to keep their balance.  the action is more one of pushing than striking at and children don\'t tend to swing their legs back that far.  However, they are learning to visually direct their foot towards the ball and to keep their bodies in balance as they proceed with the motion.  These are very important developmental progressions.  At the next stage, children often take a few deliberate steps towards the ball, swing their legs from their knees keeping the kicking leg bent throughout the whole kick, using a backswing that originates from the knee.  There is some follow-through that involves the forward movement of the child\'s knee.  As children\'s kicking matures, they learn to start farther behind the ball and moves their total body into it (Curtis, 1982).  They tend to approach the ball by running or leaping, the length of the swing of the leg increases, the waist bends during follow-through, the kicking originates from the waist instead of the knee and the support leg bends slightly.  The follow-through is higher and the support foot may rise up on the child\'s toes or leave the ground entirely.  Children learn to swing their arms in opposition to each other during the actual kicking action. ','Kicking',NULL,'Peter sees the red and yellow beach ball roll in front of him on the grassy lawn.  The movement attracks him.  He chases the ball, falling on the ball as he misjudges his momentum.  He laughs, gets up and looks at his father who is standing nearby.  \"Kick the ball to me!\' his father says as he gestures a kick with his right leg.  Peter knows what his father means, approaches the ball until his right leg has made resting contact with the beach ball.  He lifts his leg straight out, propelling the ball foward with moderate, but certainly not explosive, force.   \"Well done!\" his father shouts as he retrieve the ball.','Peter knows what it means to kick even though he has more to learn about where to stand and how to bend his knee.  He stands directly next to the ball as if he has to make contact with the ball before he tries to move the ball.  His approach is somewhat of an overgeneralization of lessons he has learned about moving other objects.  That is, he has overlearned, so to speak, that if you what to lift an object you have to touch it first.   So, to make the ball move, you have to make contact with it first.','Kicking involves a set of muscle movements that are found in actions other than actual kicking\n\n• Trying to get a slipper off the right foot by swinging the foot out quickly\n• Knocking a tuft of grass down that is an obstacle underfoot\n• Swinging the calves back and forth while sitting on the top of a child table\n','Kicking a beach ball is not so easy for a toddler.  Often a toddler will stand too close to a ball on the ground and just raise his/her leg without punching the ball with the foot.

For instance, children might demonstrate this by interest in moving a toy train along a track, zooming a car through a tunnel while anticipating where it will come through, and so on.  Children\'s understanding of movement includes an understanding of how familiar objects are likely to move in an anticipated trajectory.  In an observation by Piaget (1952), reported by Berger (1988), the  child arrives at a closed door with a blade of grass in each hand. She stretches out her right hand toward the knob but sees that she can\'t turn the knob and hold the grass at the same time.  She solves this by putting the grass on the floor, opening the door and then picking the grass up.  Leaving the room is more complicated, however, because when she puts the grass on the floor and grasps the doorknob, she realizes that in pulling the door toward her, the door will push away her pile of grass placed between the door and the threshold. Anticipating the movement path of the door, she picks up the grass and places it outside the door\'s path of movement (Berger, 1988).\n\nResearchers (Sinclair, Stambak, Lezine, Rayna, & Verba, 1989) report on a study in which children from 12 to 24 months of age were presented with a collection of varied objects, including cotton wool, clay, beads, tubes, string, and rubber bands.  Their spontaneous actions were recorded.  At around 24 months of age, their primary interest was in the threading of two objects.   Around 24 months the children began to center on two main types of problems, either creating stable relationship between objects (stacking two objects) or creating unstable relationship (moving a bead on a stiff wire).  This difference lead to a distinction between experimenting with movement and fabricating a product.  For example, in experimentation the child might be intrigued with the gradual disappearance of a length of spaghetti inside a tube and its gradual reappearance, or intrigued with the direction of sliding a bead on a stiff wire.  In fabrication the child is interested in making a ball of cotton longer or is interested in making a strange loop of string.  This shift towards focusing on the relationships between the two objects and specifically the movement of one in relation to another was contemporaneous with other activities dealing with one object, e.g. shape changing of the string and rubber band.  At earlier ages, children demonstrated other types of interests and abilities.  For instance, the main action at 12 months consisted of putting one object into another. By 16 months children showed an interest in fragmenting an object (tearing cotton wool into smaller pieces).  Just as putting into is frequently followed by taking out, so tearing to bits is followed by putting together when the material allowed this to happen.  Combining took the form of threading, piercing, building, and making parcels.\n','Action on objects',NULL,'Jackie has for some weeks played with a set of objects left in her room, a plastic straw about five inches long, a two inch wooden bead, cone shaped, flat at the larger bottom and smaller top, and a stick about three inches long that can easily fit both in the straw and in the conical bead.  Today Jackie is intrigued with how she can make the stick reappear by first placing it in the straw that she holds vertically on the table and then by raising the bottom of the straw just a little.  Next she takes the stick in one hand, lowers it into the straw, but does not let it drop through the vertical shaft of the straw.  Instead she uses her finger to press the stick against the inside wall of the straw.  While wedging the straw thusly, she moves the bottom opening of the straw over on top of the bead resting on the table.  She carefully aligns the bottom opening of the straw with the hole in the bead.  Then she releases the stick so that it falls down the shaft of the tube.  At that point she slowly lifts the straw and reveals about one inche of the stick standing straight up from the bead.  She is delighted.','Jackie has demonstrated not only some amazing manual skill but some even more amazing thinking.  First, in terms of the fine motor skills, she is able to press the small stick to the inside wall of the straw, while at the same time moving the straw until it is aligned with the hole in the bead resting on the table.  But in terms of her thinking, she realizes that if she delays dropping the stick through the straw until the two openings are aligned, that the stick will pass into the hole of the bead.  This is rather advanced thinking about movement of objects, primarily because the movement has not and can be witnessed.  It must be anticipated and the imagined even when it actually happens.

This means that they have developed the body strength to actually propel themselves into the air.  There is a fair amount of variation in when children become able to jump with two feet.   At younger ages, children can jump down from things.  This means that while children have developed the ability to coordinate some of the movements at younger ages, such as coordinating the crouch, flexion of the trunk, and body movements of a jump (as reported in Stewart, 1980), they still don\'t have the actual strength to propel themselves into the air (Hellebrandt et al., 1961).  Children sometimes think they are jumping when their feet aren\'t actually leaving the ground.\n\nHere are some mini-milestones that occur along the road to jumping for distance and height.  D. L Gallahue (1976) and R. L. Wickstrom (1977) report that by around 18 months, children master stepping down from low objects, by 24 months, they are learning to jumps down from low objects using both of their feet and to jumps off the floor from a standing position using both feet.  By around 37 months, children begin to refine this jump and jumps from low object with their arms back when leaping and can typically  remain standing when they land.  By 40 months of age, children are refining their jumping skills considerably.  Now they can jumps a short distance, using their arms to help gain distance, crouching low before extending their legs, leaning forward and leaping with arms back.  They land with arms forward to provide greater stability.  By around 47 months of age, children can do a  vertical jump.  They look up with their heads, crouch their bodies, hurls their arms up to gain height, arch their backs as end of the total spring. \nBy 60 months of age, children can do a standing long jump.   They can lean over to a starting position (back almost horizontal), leap at a sharp angle to floor hurling their arms forward and landing in a crouched position. At this age, children tend to realize the need to coordinate both horizontal and vertical motion to maximize the distance jumped (Curtis, 1982).\n','Jumping',NULL,'Shantia and Dion were running around indoors.  Their outdoor play had been cut short by an afternoon shower.  The mothers were in the next room planing a fund raiser for their church.  Shantia climbs up on the ottoman and looks down at Dion. Then Shantia jumps with both feet and lands firmly on the floor retaining her upright stance.  Dion, pretty much the same age as Shantia, accepts the challenge.  But Dion does not make a clean jump. Rather she makes an exaggerated step with one leg, easing herself down with her elevated left knee still on the ottoman as her right foot touches the floor.  Shantia accepts this action as a response to the game, mounts the ottomon, and makes another clean jump with both feet.  Dion again uses an exaggerated step, but this time she steps out a little further than before and quickly pulls her left knee from the ottomon.  After few more rounds of this game the girls turn their interest to sometime more sedentary with small replica objects.','Even though the two girls are at the same age, Shantia is slightly more advanced in motor development than Dion.  This advance could result from slight differences in muscular development, but it could also represent slight differences in their openess to risk.  While age of onset for various milestones may continue to show a slight age difference between the two girls, Dion will nevertheless progress in a normal sequence.  Also of interest is Shantai\'s acceptance of Dion\'s form of stepping off the otoman rather than jumping with both feet.  Motor development at this age does not include an ability to evaluate the quality of a friend\'s attempt to imitate.

Then a second child will read those actions and translate them to a new set of materials and as a set of motor instructions for him or herself.  Thus, he or she imitates a novel sequence of motor pattern actions that were performed by the first child.

Hannah exclaims, \"You did it.\"  and then to her observing mother, \"I helped him Momma.\"','In addition to this poignant observation of an older child helping a younger child, this observation has much to tell us about what children know about the way objects work and how well they can read the problem.  For example, the main problem for Kyle was the fact that he aligned the two stars in the same horizontal plane instead of twisting one to the vertical.  But Hannah, at least as indicated by her verbal instructions, assumed that Kyle was just not pushing them hard enough.  Of course, the harder Kyle pushed, the more likely the two blocks would slip off each other, because the gaps between the radiating arms of one blocks was not sliding into the gap of the radiating arms in the other block.  Nevertheless, Kyle probably learned something about the twist because Hannah, as she held the blocks with Kyles hands on them, did indeed twist the blocks.

Researchers tend to refer to two types of balance, static balance and dynamic balance.  Static balance refers to the ability to maintain balance while standing still or when in a stationary position.  Dynamic balance refers to balance while moving.  Static balance tends to be achieved at around 29 months of age (Bayley, 1935) as cited in Zaichowsky, Zaichowsky, & Martinek, 1980).  Children have been working at static balance since the time that they first started pulling themselves up to a standing position.  Prior to two years of age, many children have difficulty with static balance on one foot or dynamic balance on two feet and tend to fall a lot when they walk (Zaichowsky, Zaichowsky, & Martinek, 1980).  By the time children are three years old, they are able to balance on one foot for three to four seconds (Zaichowsky et al., 1980).   They are also learning dynamic balance and by three, many children can walk about 10 feet on a one inch line successfully (Zaichowsky et al., 1980).   Soon, children learn to master all sorts of situations involving balance, such as lifting a bucket of sand while pivoting one\'s body around.  This involves coordinating understandings about dynamic balance with predictions about weight as well as the rotation of the pivot.\n\n \nBalance also involves a sense of laterality.  This means an inner awareness for the difference between the two sides of the body.  Throughout the preschool years, children are slowly developing this sense.  Until it is established, the child may not have a feeling for the midline of his body, may show poor balance in a variety of activities (Skinner, 1979).\n\nPediatricians have used standing on one foot as a test to measure neurological development, though experts agree that if  neurological problems exist, they tend to show up much earlier. Balancing is also a little scary; children who have trouble with this skill may simply be intimidated.  Good balance can also be related to the size of a child\'s feet as children with larger feet have a broader base of support.  Good balance evolves with strength, experience, practice, and exposure.\n','Balancing ',NULL,'Dean loves to watch and imitate his friend Charlie, only one mouths older.

Much of this accommodation is done in advance in a predictive sense, that is, the child knows what type of object she is trying to lift.  For example, if the object will likely fall apart, such as a deck of cards, the child knows to make some attempts to cradle the set of cards on the side.  Or if the object has a very heavy side, such as a metal hammer head on a wooden handle, the child knows to hold the object firmly before lifting, and can make adjustments in where to grip the handle in order to prevent the object from tilting out of her hand.  Children\'s grip assumes the expected shape in advance of coming into contact with the object.  \n\nResearch shows that children begin making predictions about weight at even much earlier ages.  Mounoud and Hauert (1982) tested this ability by examining infants\' reactions when a heavy object, to which they had been prompted to grasp several times, was replaced by an object identical in size but lighter in weight.  The researchers observed that after substituting the heavy object with the lighter one, the youngest infants in the study (6 to 8 months) did not exhibit any noticeable signs of surprise, but that the older infants (9-16 months) would stare at the substituted object or began to shake, appearing surprised by the change in weight. Around 15 months of age, children further develop the ability to predict an object\'s weight based on its size and begin to make fine motor adjustments in anticipation of the weight.  Mounoud and Hauert (1982) examined children\'s ability to anticipate the weight of an object by handing a series of large and small objects in increasing and decreasing order to infants, and observed how the infants adjusted their grasp for large and small objects.  The researchers observed that upon grasping the objects, the speed of movement and the drop of the arm in 9 -13 months old was proportional to the weight of the objects, while 14-16 month old infants were able to grasp the objects of various weights without a significant difference in speed or arm drop.  Mounoud and Hauert suggest that this indicates a difference in ability to predict weight based on size, as the younger infants distinguished the weight of the objects during, rather than before, the grasping action, while the older infants first predicted the weight of the object based on it\'s size and adjusted their grasp of each object accordingly.  These differences in behavior suggest that by 14-16 months of age, children\'s ability to predict and accommodate perceived size and predicted weight is quite developed. \n','Fine Motor Skills',NULL,'Adam is playing outside with water and sand in some buckets.

By now, children have long mastered the fundamentals of opening their fingers in order to deliberately drop an object (12 - 15 months) and to swing their arms in order to hurl an object some distance from themselves (15 - 18 months). This latter action requires that children open their fingers before their arm movement has completed but not before their arm begins to move.  These early actions are learned from a seated position, on the floor or in a high chair, as every parent knows who has had to repeatedly retrieve the objects hurled across the room.  \n   \nAt this point in development, children build their throwing skills typically while standing.  Researchers (Curtis, 1982; Wickstrom, 1983) have defined the following stages in learning to throw a ball.  In these initial stages, children throw using primarily a forearm extension with the upper arm in a relatively stationary horizontal position.  The ball is released in a timely manner as the child\'s hand passes the ear.  The child\'s feet remain stationary and do not add to the forward momentum of the throw.  The forearm extension itself is an advance over the earlier throws from the highchair, because in those earlier throws the elbow is usually not bent. Not only is the throw, thereby, less accurate, but also there is little intention to throw the object to or at a target.  However, at this later age the child often orients toward a target and is deliberately aims at a spot, usually another person trying to catch the ball.  Thus the advance from 18 months to now is significant.  The standing throw to a person using elbow extension is more complicated than a whole arm swing from a sitting position with no target in mind. In a second stage, the child adds some body rotation to the side opposite the throw.  The child gets ready by cocking his or her hand behind the head and then as he or she rotates his or her trunk to the left, the throwing arm is brought around along a horizontal plane.  In a third stage, the child takes a forward step with the leg on the same side of the body as the throwing arm.  This provides additional force for the throw.  The child learns to step forward on the foot that is on the same side as the throwing arm.  Finally, as the child learns a mature throwing pattern, the child rotates his or her trunk backward to get ready for the throw, then using a contralateral step moves his or her body weight forward rotating hips, shoulders, and trunk to the left while completing the throwing action with the arm.  Curtis (1982) refers to this as a \"Step-Turn-Throw\" pattern.\n','Throwing',NULL,'Alphoso has a plastic bowling ball about the size of a large orange.  He undestands the game of knocking over the plastic bowling pens that stand before him about three feet away.  He takes his left hand, holds the ball firmly, brings his hand back in an underarm swing and the reverses his swing releasing the ball as it passes his knee.  The ball lofts over the tops of the two bowling pins and falls on the other side.  Alphonso retrieves the ball and tries again. This time he relaease the ball a little sooner and the trajectory flattens out sufficiently to actually roll the ball across the floor.  He misses both pins however.  On the third attempt Alphonso decides to stand a little closer to the pins.  He releases his underhand bowl, again, without the loft and the ball grazes one of the two pins, making it tweeter and then fall over.  Alphonso approaches the remaining pin and kicks it over with his foot.','In this short episode Alphonso was able to improve his undersrm throw.  By releasing the ball slightly later than his first attempt he was able to eliminate the lofting trajectory.  He did not regress during the next two attempts.  When he still missed on the second attempt, he changed his strategy.  He stood closer to the pins.  But because he could not figure out a bowling path that would knock over both pins, he knocked over only one.  At this point he changed more than his strategy.  He changed his goal altogether.

A thrown ball gives the child a sense of power because the effect of the body continues beyond the finger tips.

You can help this transition by changing the objective of the throw to force rather than aim.  Use a large box or something substantial that needs a certain force to knock it off the table\'s edge or the back of the sofa.  If the object is large then the aim need not be so important.

(Espenschade & Eckert, 1980; Grieve & Gaer, 1966; Wickstrom, 1977)  Mature walking is characterized by an increased step length, heel contacting the ground with the knee straight. The child\'s weight rolls forward so the toe pushes and then knee bends as it is lifted off the ground.  Toes generally point straight ahead.  Children place their feet closer together, narrowing the base of support.  Their forward lean decreases and there is hip rotation to the back to the support leg, then forward to the side of the moving leg.  Children hold their arms straight and often swing them at the sides of their bodies (Gallahue, 1982; Wickstrom, 1977).\n\nThe earlier phases of walking are characterized as follows (Gallahue, 1982 from an unpublished dissertation by Gad-Elmawla, 1980; Wickstrom, 1977).  Initial walking is characterized by shorter, rigid steps, with toes turned outward and flat footed contact.  Children\'s knees bend as their foot touches the ground, then straightens quickly.  They have relatively no ankle movement.  Their legs are often bent excessively.  Their toes tend to point out and their feet are spread apart wide.  Their bodies have a slight forward lean with no hip rotation.   Immature walkers tend to lose their balance and fall more often and use their arms for balance so they tend to hold their arms up with their elbows bent for protection against falls (high-guard position).  As their gait matures, their dynamic base narrows quickly, high-guard arm position is abandoned, and heel-strike is usually present in walking form by age two years  (Wickstrom, 1977).  Eventually, their initial gait is replaced by a lengthening step, heel to toe contact, and straighter toes. \n','Mature Walking',NULL,'Jenny loves to play outdoors.

Children\'s early attempts are not very refined at this age.  These early attempts often involve some form of trapping the ball into the chest with the arms held straight out in front of the body, palms up.  As the ball makes contact with the arms, the child\'s elbows bend (Curtis, 1982).  If the ball is small, children may clap at the ball or use hands like a vise if the ball is small.  It is not uncommon for children to turn their heads to one side and lean back.  This trapping approach is necessary because the child has not yet learned to visually track the flight of the ball in the air and make the necessary arm adjustments while the ball is in flight, moving only when the ball makes contact with the arms.  For this reason, children at this age are not ready to play catch with smaller balls that are not easily trapped (Curtis, 1982).  A precursor to catching involves stopping a rolling ball (Hottinger, 1980).\n  \nDevelopmentalists suggest that catching is one of the most difficult skills for children to master due to the perceptual requirements and the large number of variables involved.  Perceptually, it involves tracking a dynamic object.  A child must be able to judge where it will land and how soon it will get to a particular spot from the time that thrower releases it.  It requires good eye-hand coordination (Zaichowsky, Zaichowsky, & Martinek, 1980). These perceptual skills take years to fully develop (Curtis, 1982).  Additionally, variables such as the size of the ball (larger balls are easier), the path of the ball through the air (low is easier), the distance between the thrower and catcher (closer is easier), the speed with which the ball is thrown, whether the child must move to catch the ball, and, if so, in what direction affect the level of difficulty involved in catching the ball (Curtis, 1982).   \n\nAs children\'s catching skills mature, they tend to go through the following stages.  They progress to putting their arms out in front with their elbows bent slightly and attempt to encircle the ball as it approaches in an automated type of performance. Later, they allow the ball to bounce from their chests to be controlled by their arms.  Finally, they learn to position their hands to grasps and controls ball.  They learn to bend at their knees and hips and continue to move and give way in direction ball came from in order to absorb the force of the ball (Curtis, 1982). \n','Gross Motor  Catching',NULL,'Darleen stands ready to catch the soft volley ball that she and her brother, Sonny, are using outdoors.

Darleen stands somewhat stiffly, as if her concentration on the ball causes her to ignore herself.  The ball hits the inside of her forearms before she makes any gesture to catch the ball.  When the contact is made with the ball, Darleen quickly curls her forearms towards her chest in hopes of trapping the ball between hands and chest.  Unfortunately the soft volley ball makes a slight bounce off her forearms which means that the ball is no longer in the trapping path of her forearms.  She chases the ball and then throws it to her older brother who catches the ball by clapping the hands together from right and left to the midline.  On the next toss Darleen seems to make a slight accommodation to what she had seen Danny do, except that her clap was somewhat late, causing her to trap the ball between her forearms instead of between her hands.  Sensing that the ball will fall from this tenuous clasping action, she quickly once again curls her forearms toward her chest.','Learning to catch is a slow and painstaking process of learning a move, and then unlearning that move in order to \"make room\" for another.

This means that function of the two hands are becoming more differentiated.  To facilitate the movements involved in the one handed catch you can play catching games with the velcro mit that you have seen at toy stores.  The velcro mit and ball will help #first# think about the timing between the primary hand with the mit and the back up hand that is free.','The development of catching helps #first# think about how the two hands can work together while accomplishing slightly different effects, one hand to stop the forward movement of the ball and the second to prevent the ball from bouncing out of the hand.   Watch for this gradual and subtle change in the style of catching, from both hands trapping the ball, to one hand stopping and the other hand preventing the rebound.  In general this skill at catching a ball is an affirmation of how #first# can defy the inevitable fall of an object to the ground, an object that is at that point in time, already falling.  It is no wonder that children reap so much pleasure in catching.  Stopping a rolling object can be fun, but catching a falling (tossed) object is a rush.  ',NULL,NULL,'Catching is more difficult than throwing.  But there are component skills to catching that you can play in a variety of activities that do not require #first# to bring all the skills of catching together.  For example, #first# can stop a rolling ball more easily, since the rolling ball moves in only two dimensions instead of three.  Here is a suggestion.  Set up a wide board, propped up on one end to create an incline for a tennis ball to roll down.  Take a large pasteboard box, place it at the bottom of the incline and cut out two holes slightly larger than the tennis ball.   Place the holes so the tennis ball can roll down the incline and out either of the holes. ','Invite #first# to stop the tennis ball when it comes rolling out.  Vary the position of your release so that #first# will not know which hole the ball will exit.  Disuade #first# from putting #his/her# hands directly over the holes.  The objective is to have #first# be quick once #he/she# sees the ball apear.  The element of surprise adds a bit of fun to the game.  ','If you sense that game is just one step beyond #first#\'s skill, then remove the box and ask #him/her# to catch the ball when it rolls down the wide board.  Vary the position of your release so that #first# will have to deal with different speeds and different locations.  You can increase the speed of the ball either by placing it higher on the board or by increasing the inclined angle of the board.    If this works well, you can try once again to hide part of the release by using a cloth to shield your hand at the top of the board.   The ball can then exit from the hem of cloth.','In time you will be able to add more degrees of freedom to the movements that #first# deals with to stop the ball.  A board that is both inclined and lists to the side will create more action than a straight incline.  Perhaps a huge bowl shaped surface can be pliable pasteboard.   Or changing the incline while the ball is rolling will increase the challenge, but it is still short of the full blown toss in mid-air. ','By reducing the degrees of freedom in the movement of the ball, you are giving #first# an opportunity to practice \"catching\" a ball without having to think about all the components of catching it in mid-air.  These activities let #him/ her#deal with location, speed, and even the element of surprise.  In addition, the game involves both of you and there are always positive benefits from enjoying an activity together.

In some respects, running is like walking except that in mature running, there is a point of time when both feet are off the ground- a period of nonsupport when the body is airborne.  This is referred to as the flight phase and is a period of time when there is no support from the ground (Gallahue, 1982).  Some researchers (Slocum & James, 1968) think of running as like a series of coordinated jumps.  This helps to suggest the leg strength that a child has to have in order to engage in \"true\" running (Stewart, 1980).  Researchers ( Seefeld et al., 1972; Wickstrom, 1977) have identified three stages of running (as reported in Gallahue, 1982).  The initial stage [See Movement LW- Running as Exaggerated Walking] does not have a flight stage, nor does it depend upon mature walking (Broer & Zernicke, 1979).  The second stage does have a very brief flight stage and so can be considered \"true\" running.  Children progress to a longer stride, longer and increased arm swing, and increased speed. Children\'s supporting leg extends more at take-off and the swinging foot crosses the midline when the child is at the height of recovery to the rear.  As children reach a mature stage, there is a definite flight stage.  The support leg extends completely and the stride is fast and at the maximum length possible.  The recovery thigh is parallel to the ground and there is little rotation in the recover leg or foot.  The arms bend at almost right angles and swing vertically in opposition to the legs.\n','\"True\" Running ',NULL,'Merris has progressed from a hurried walk to a true run.  Now when she runs there are intervals when both feet are off the ground.  She clinches her fists and swings her arms as if to pump force into her longer strides.  She raises her knee so high that her heel touches her tousch with each running step.  Yet her airborn moments are brief since she has not quite learned how to spring forward and long immediately after a foot strikes the ground.  Nevertheless, her movements are quick and are a true run.','Learning to run involves a host of skills.  Merris mush cock her knee sufficiently to impart sufficient force to the ground to become airborne immediately thereafter.  Without this downward thrust the movement remains a hurried walk.  She must also think about her forward momentum and use the angle of upper body with the ground to both keep herself moving forward yet not so forward as to risk falling on her face. Eventually she will add refinement to these moves by tucking the arms higher to the chest and by using the rapid forward acceleration of the knee to gain altitude in when both legs are extended in midstride.  ','Walking, running, skipping, and hopping are all instances of translocating in a single direction forward while standing.  Here are situations that use components moves for the \"true\" run.\n\n• Standing in place and then hurling the body forward in a jumping step, such that the whole body is off the ground momentarily.\n• Jogging in place with an emphasis on bringing the knees high into the chest\n• Running over small pillows placed at equal intervals just slightly longer than the stride of a hurried walk.\n','#first# will develop from a tentative and perhaps awkward run on the toes to a full blown fast and heel first run later.  As you witness the onset of this more mature form of running, find space and reasons to actually jog parallel to #first#.  You could run along a familiar and long sidewalk, run all the way to the bottom of a hill.  Anything, but find some space and sitatuion where the running lasts for several minutes, is not hurried, and you and #first# can establish and notice each others rhythym.  Such situations are fantastic for improving the form and strength of #first#\'s running, but also strengthen your relation with each other.

The child must be able to bring together the skills of swinging an object, bringing it in contact with another object, and coordinating the path of one to another.  This involves eye hand coordination.  Attempting to strike a resting ball requires a large degree of hand-eye coordination and knowledge about direction of force.   The task is especially tricky if the object to be hit is moving because then the child must take into account the dynamics of the moving object. [See V/S LW Early Developing Competencies of Dynamic Imagery- 42 Month Old.]  Children have the most success hitting a moving ball when they can face the thrower and use an overhand strike.  This makes it possible for the child to see the object throughout the striking movement.  The pattern reduces the amount of strength, balance, time, and coordination required because it permits children to limit the total range of motion and the number of levers to be applied while striking. Young children tend to swing immediately upon seeing the ball released from the hand of the thrower (Wickstrom, 1983).  If the object to be hit is moving on the ground, this entails less complexity in coordinating the strike than if the object is moving in the air (such as when hitting a baseball).','Beach Ball Golf',NULL,'Lauren and her mother are playing with an inflatable ball.  It is about the size of a basketball.  Nearby on the ground are two toy golf clubs.  Lauren\'s mother takes one and pushes the ball to to Lauren, using the club in a scouping fashion rather than a striking fashion.  Lauren takes the other club and places it under the ball.  As she tried to lift it up to propel it to her mother, the ball rolls round and off the face of the club.  She brings the club down on top of the ball, perhaps to stop it, but then she repeats the vertical slam two more times, eventually sending the ball away in an unpredictable manner.  This time Lauren\'s mother carefully models stricking the ball with the club.  She lines up her shot, draws the club back and follows through the stroke as the ball springs toward Lauren.  Lauren walks over to with her golf club in order to strike the ball.  She falters in her step and accidentally strikes the ball from the side.  But now she steadies the club, places it directly against the ball as before, and tries to lift the ball in order to make it roll over to her mother.','Lauren needs to solve is a conceptual trick in order to strike a ball resting on the ground.  She needs to think that it is o.k. to move the club backward in order to make the ball go forward.   Since this makes no sense to her, she places the club directly against the ball before she exerts force on it with the push.  Interestingly enough, Lauren kicks a ball the same way, by placing her foot directly against the ball before she extends her foot forward.  While it is true that her mother modeled this lift off strategy on the first round, her mother also was quick to remodel the more efficient strategy upon seeing the difficulty Lauren was having.  But what Lauren can not understand (the backswing) she probably does not notice.  Nevertheless, it is quite significant that Lauren has learned something by watching her mother.   Motor development is a combination of imitating what you understand and eventually inventing or reconstituiting those pieces of the action that you need in order to improve the action on your own.  ','There are a number of movements in striking a ball that can be found in other situations.\n\n• Catching an object swinging like a pendulum on a string\n• Pointing a stick at a small, but stationary point\n• Swinging a stick without its momentum causing it to fly out of the hand\n• Kicking a ball with a back swing of the leg before the follow through kick\n','Tossing, catching, and hitting a ball are great fun and support physical and social development.  Compared to tossing and catching, hitting adds a new element of challenge.  Now it is a stick or bat that has to \"catch\" the ball, instead of the hands that the child knows so well.  The bat has an orientation and location in space that is related to the position of the hands, but is not identical to the position of the hands.  Start these games with bats that are short and thick, more like paddles and eventually work toward bats that are long and skinny.  Encourage #first# to hit using #his/her# preferred hand only, since holding the bat with two hands adds yet another variation that is remote from striking an object with #his/her# own hand, e.g. swatting at a fly.   Gradually transition from a one handed tap to a one handed hit to a two handed hit. ','Hitting a Moving Target',NULL,'There are many variations on hitting an object with a stick.  Even hitting a pinata (a hanging paper mache figure filled with trinkets) requires some of the same skills as hitting a baseball.  Knocking the tassel off a tall blade of grass, swipping at the top of a fencepost.  Look for an opportunity to model one of these situations where the object is stationary and #first# can take a horizontal swipe at the object with a stick or bat.','After you model the action, let #first# have a turn.  Your actions, at a minimum, lets #first# know that the strike is safe and non-distrustive.  Watch to see how #first# moves the bat.  Does #he/she# snap #his/wrist# when the bat comes close to the target?  Does #he/she# look at the object throughout the swing.  Let say the situation is a tall weed, and you notice that #first# is looking way beyond the weed as #he/she# swings.','Given that you noticed that #first# is not keeping #his/her# eyes on the target, you can make up some extra special reason to look at the weed.  \"I think I see a tiny, tiny seed on top of that weed.  I am going to knock off just that one little seed when I swing.  I think there is a tiny tiny seed on your\'s too.\"','As #first# gets better at hitting stationary objects you can model hitting objects that swing themselves, such as a tennis ball hanging from a string or a pinata.  Adding a blindfold does not improve the game as a motor development task, but does change the game into a spatial task of using touch cues to locate the pinata.','Swiping at objects that are anchored on a pedestal or hanging from a string makes it more likely that #first# will use a horizontal stroke.  #first# can use a little help to over-ride #his/her#  tendency to use a downward vertical stroke.

','The Slow Pitch Wiffle',NULL,'There are occasions, such as family picnics, beach vacations, or play on the sidewalks when #first# likes the activity of hitting a ball.  You are well aware of #his/her# energy level and skill, so begin the game of tossing a ball so #first# can bat it with a plastic baseball bat.  The ball can be as big as a softball, a wiffle ball is good.  You toss the ball and *first# takes a swing.','Notice if #first# is swinging too early or just right, or if #first# is coming down on the ball from a vertical position.  Keep your tosses level so that #first# does not have to deal with a trajectory that changes too much.  Do not give several warm up moves of your arm.  Just draw your arm back moderately fast and follow through with a forward toss at the same speed that you used to draw your arm back.  There is no need to say \"Here it comes.\"  Often this just makes a child anxious and even distracts a child from watching the ball.   If #first# is interested in the game, #he/she# will watch for the release of the ball.','If #first# is coming down on the ball in a swatting action, it may be best to change the game for a while.  Use a paddle instead of a baseball bat.  It is o.k. to swat a ball using a vertical downward swing with a paddle.  Toss the ball somewhat higher, since that is were #first# initiates the swing anyway.  Rest assured that #first# is still improving, even though you have encouraged #him/her# to shift from a horizontal swing to a vertical swing. ','After #first# masters the plane of the swing, that is the horizontal plane, you may still notice a tendency to swing to early.  #First#\'s ability to delay the swing will come in a few months of practice.

','Hitting a ball is just another activity that both causes and indicates #first#\'s motor development.  Yet hitting a ball in our culture means so much more than hand-eye coordination.

(Lowrey, 1986)  They can manage to undress themselves with the exception of difficult buttons and fastenings and can hang up their own clothing (Berger, 1988).  They can also do jigsaw puzzles by trial and error, place pellets in a narrow neck bottle, and begin to use scissors (Harris, 1986).  Most notable at this stage is the increased control over the thumb. This differentiation of the four fingers from the grip of thumb and palm allows the child to do things such as move his fingers over the stops of a recorder while keeping instrument securely held  (Harris, 1986).  Children can master such tasks as cutting with scissors and perfect this skill between 36 and 60 months of age. Cutting a sheet of paper with a pair of scissors requires the coordination of an incredible number of components (Forman, 1977).  The scissors must be held with the blades open, in a vertical plane, perpendicular to the plane of the sheet of paper.  The scissors must be controlled often with only two fingers, a handicap right from the start.  The paper needs to be pushed far back into the open jaw of the blades.  The scissor blades must then be closed on the paper in such a manner that the cutting edges of the blades make the critical first shear of the paper.  If the scissors twist to an angle less that about 80 degrees from the plane of the paper, the paper slips over the cutting edge and slides between the two blades.  The child must both hold the paper stable with his left hand (non-preferred hand) and close the blades with his right hand, maintaining this critical perpendicular throughout the movement of the blades.   It is no wonder why the completion of skilled cutting with scissor may not occur until well into the fifth year of life.  Ironically the success at cutting can be delayed by mediocre scissors.  It is not often that children are given the high quality scissors that makes cutting easier.','Small Muscle Coordiation',NULL,'Samatha has developed an interest in making noises with musical instruments.

She moves the harmonica to the right and to the left.  At one point she discovers she can make a single note rather than the concaphonous sounds of before.  She pauses and concentrates her blow on just one spot.  When she blows too hard more than one tone sounds.  She modulates her blow to make the single sound.  Now she moves the harmonica to the left, but more slowly.  She discovers another note that she can make as a single sound.  To this discovery she adds her previous discovery of sucking air into the harmonica.  The key changes between sucking in and blowing out at the same spot.

She is now at a stage of trying to make particular sounds, not particular pitches, but at least single pitches.  In order to accomplish this she must narrow her embouchure (configuration of her mouth) to isolate her breath to a single hole.  And to find other single notes, she slides the harmonica more slowly so that she does not overshoot her mark.  The creation of music is a combination of setting some musical goal and appropriating the motor control necessary to generate the desired effects.   She can control the speed of sliding the harmonica, the size of the opening of her mouth, the force of her breathe, and the direction of breathing (in or out).

For example, if #first# holds the paper in #his/her# left hand and cuts out a moon by changing the angle of the scissors in #his/her# right hand, the intended object \"grows\" in #his/her# left hand that holds the intended object.  But if the intended object needs to be the paper that falls to the table, the task is more difficult to think about.

The paper separates into two pieces that have edges as clean as the original edges of the whole piece of paper.  The child feels better about cutting than tearing because the clean edges feel more like creating than destroying.

Hopping is a complex skill and children don\'t tend to become proficient at it until about 6 years old (Breckenridge & Vincent, 1956; Zaichowsky, Zaichowsky, & Martinek, 1980).  Hopping is  a one foot takeoff that lands on the same foot (Gallahue, 1976).  It requires a good deal more strength and balance than jumping (Hottinger, 1980; Zaichowsky et al., 1980) or leaping down from objects [See related Learning Windows-  Jumping with Both Feet and Stepping Down From Low Objects] because the child must be able to support all of his or her weight on one leg and must maintain enough balance to sustain the movement.  While children are developing increasing leg strength and can support their weight on both legs around the end of the first year of life, they won\'t develop enough lower leg strength to hop until around 4 years old.  Children achieve static balance sometime after their second birthdays (Bayley, 1935), however, hopping requires maintaining balance while moving--a dynamic balance.  Children tend to hop on a preferred foot (Robertson & Halverson, 1984). \n\nHalverson and Williams (as cited in Robertson & Halverson, 1984) outline the following sequence through which hopping progresses.  In it\'s initial stages, the supporting knee and hip pull up from the floor quickly to achieve a momentary leap or period of non-support (as in the flight stage in running).  Children hold the other leg up high and keep it inactive.  Typically children manage to achieve one or two hops in sequence. At the second stage, children lean their bodies forward in a position that makes it easier to practice hopping while being able to catch oneself if they fall.  They extend their knee and angle only slightly.  This positioning allows for relatively stable repeat hops.  At the third stage, children learn to project rather than pull themselves as they takeoff into a hop.  Children ready themselves with a noticeable pre-take-off extension of the hip, knee, and ankle and the progression from knee and ankle flexion to extension in order to take off is smooth with little delay.  At this stage, the other leg is used as a swing leg and it \"pumps\" to assist in the hopping.  At the fourth stage, children are able to smoothly transfer weight upon landing along the foot to the ball of the foot such that the foot absorbs some of the force of the hop (and provides stability) as the knee and ankle extend for the next take-off.  The supporting leg extends almost fully during take-off.  The other leg now clearly helps with the upward movement, leading in the next cycle of upward movement while the support leg is still rotating along the foot to absorb bounce.  The pumping of the swing leg has a longer range (note present at stage three) and passes the support leg when viewed from the side.   \n\nWhile children don\'t typically choose to hop as a preferred from of movement, hopping is often a part of other games or moves such as skipping  (Robertson & Halverson, 1984).  Some developmentalists suggest that girls tend to be more proficient at hopping than boys and offer the following explanations.  Girls tend to play more hopping games and tend to be slightly more advanced in physical maturity  (Hottinger, 1980; Zaichowsky et al., 1980). \n','Jumping Peak to Peak',NULL,'Katy was holding a baby doll in one hand, tucked under her arm.  She mounted the first of seven large wooden boxes that her teachers at preschool has placed all in a row about ten inches apart.  Katy had see the older children merily hop from the peak of one box to the other in a game with no particular rules other than to finish the challenge.  She stepped into the valley between two peaks and then stepped up on the top of the second box.  But aften this tentative beginning, she mustered the courage and hopped over with both feet from the second to the third box top.  Her subsequence jumps became more and more fluid, with less waiting time between the landing on one box and the departing from that same box to the next.  But her older friend\'s hopping was the best.  She would lean forward and hop six times in a row with nary a pause between landing and launcing.','Movement becomes more fluid because children gain in their abiltiy to anticipate one thing while doing another.  In this case, Katy will  learn how to anticipate the body posture needed to lanch her hop.  As her ability to anticipate this launching posture improves she will be able to think about launcing even before she finishes her landing. Thus the anticipation of the launching will influence the exact manner in which she lands.  Understand that this duel thinking, thinking about launching while she still has to complete her thinking about landing, is very difficult.  She must, in a sense, overlearn the body posture needed for landing so that she need not direct much attention to landing and thereby have more time to think about lauching.

Rosenbloom & Horton (1971) examined the emergence of what they called the dynamic tripod, a means of holding and manipulating a pencil or similar tool. The tripod grip is that used by most adults in holding a pen between the distal phalanx of the flexed thumb and the distal phalanx of the partially flexed index finger (the pulp surfaces being opposed) and supported on the radial side of the first phalanx of the middle digit. This posture becomes the dynamic tripod when the individual is able to move the point of the tool  in a controlled fashion by intrinsic movements. Rosenbloom & Horton (1971), in a cross-sectional study, made observations on children aged  between 18 months and 7 years and found a relationship between age and the appearance of the tripod posture followed by the dynamic tripod. The findings were confirmed by Saida and Miyashita (1979) on a group of Japanese children aged 2- to 6- years. They described a range of grip patterns linked with age and the emergence of competence in controlling the tool. The youngest children used palmar grasps, which restricted drawing actions to movements of the arm and shoulder. The tripod grip and the dynamic tripod (which is evident around the age of 4 years, a little earlier perhaps in girls) permit intrinsic movements which offer more precise means of controlling the tool (Connolly & Dagliesh, 1993).','Claire Draws Her Pigtails Straight',NULL,'CLaire has an idea about how to draw herself spinning around but is having alittle trouble making the marks do what she wants.

Each new shape carries with it new demands on technical skills.  Drawing a big circle can not be done using the \"dynamic tripod\" alone. The shoulder must be used and movements of all four joints, shoulder, elbow, wrists, and digits much be coordinated in order for the line to find its way back to the beginning of the circle.   In the early stages of drawing large and well formed circles, be aware that using a wide tip marker increases the level of success, and taping the writing paper to the table also helps.

Even so, there is a fair amount of variation in when kids learn to skip (Gutteridge, 1939; Breckenridge & Vincent, 1956).  Typically, kids learn to gallop first (Hottinger, 1980).  Skipping combines two fundamental patterns of movement, the step and the hop, into a more advanced pattern.  It is a continuous flow of the step-hop with a rhythmical alternation of the leading foot. Skipping is composed of the following movements coordinated together (Gallahue, Werner & Luedke, 1972): One foot steps forward and the weight of the body is placed on that foot, this foot is hopped on while the other foot goes forward in a walking manner, the weight shifts to the other foot and this foot is hopped on while the first foot walks forward, this continues in alternation and the arms alternate according to the feet with the opposite arm extended to the leading foot and lifting slightly (Gallahue, Werner, & Luedke, 1972).   Researchers (Gallahue, 1976) have defined a set of stages that skipping progresses through.  Initially, at about age 4 or 5, children begin with a one-footed skip.  One foot completes a step and hop before the weight is transferred to the other foot.  The other foot just steps.  Then children progress to a two-footed skip with a flat-footed landing.  Here, each foot completes a step and a hop before the weight is transferred to the other foot.  Landing from the hop is on the total foot, or on the ball of the foot, with the heel touching down before the weight is transferred.  At a third stage, children use a two-footed skip but they land on the balls of their feet. The heel doesn\'t touch down before the weight is transferred to the other foot and children begin to lean their bodies more.\n\n \nHalverson (as cited in Robertson & Halverson, 1984) hypothesizes the following related arm actions.  In the initial stage, the arms behave bilaterally to assist the skip.  This means that they pump up bilaterally up as children shift their weight  from the hopping foot to the stepping foot and then down during the hop takeoff and leap.  At the second stage, children use their arms in semi-opposition.  First, children swing their arms up bilaterally.  Starting off  the hop on the right foot, children then moves their right arm down and back slightly while they continue to move their left arm backwards until they step onto their left foot.  Then, the cycle is repeated with both arms moving forward and upward bilaterally, only this time the actions of the sides of the body are reversed.  In stage two, the arms are beginning to act in opposition at the end of the sequence though not yet at the beginning of each cycle  Finally, at stage three, children use their arms in opposition. They swing the arm opposite the stepping leg upward and forward in synchrony with that leg and then reverse direction of the arm as the stepping leg touches the floor.  They move the arm on the same side as the stepping leg backward and down in opposition to the stepping leg.  At this stage, the arms are truly in opposition and so there is not point in time when children have both hands in the front of their bodies.\n','Skipping',NULL,'Mike is testing his legs for skipping, something that he has seen his sister do for over a year now.  It looks like so much fun, the way she glides between her steps, a synchopation that Mike senses in his bones but can not quite recreate with his muscles.  His sister steps off with her right foot, coming down on her toes and before she places her foot completely flat on the ground she gives a little skip shifting her weight to her left leg at the same time.  Her arms swing gayly, left arm forward when skipping on the right foot, and right arm out when skipping on her left.  Mike has alreadly learned to hop a few times on his right foot, but is desparate to add the forward and continuous motion of skipping.  He begins on his right foot forward, but without much momentum.  He plants his foot flat, heel and toe, and then makes a jerkly little hop with his weight still firmly on his right foot.  He pauses after the hop, places his left foot down and slightly forward, then hops on the left, again landing on his full foot.  He repeats this alternation four or five times.  He is not content with this rather jerky step and hop, but somehow realizes that he has made some progress for the day.  ','A skip is not so easy.  Mike needs to think not only about landing on his right foot, but at the same time about hopping immediately thereafter.  Since he is at this stage thinking only about landing on his right foot, he allows his heel to touch the ground.  Eventually he will anticipate the skip and that forethought will help him remember to stay on his toes.  If he could land on his toes he could use the natural spring from the ankle to execute the little hop that defines the skip.  On top of all of this information to process for the right leg and foot, he has to transfer his weight to the left leg in such a manner that the skip can be executed in an alternating pattern.  To make all of these pieces reel off in a fluid manner takes, in one sense of the word, a distant view of the whole movement.  It is almost that Mike needs to know how to skip before he can successfully execute the skip.  Needless to say, being able to watch his sister to the complete movement really helps.','The step and hop can happen in a fluid manner or in other situations where they might take a slightly different form.\n\n• #first# might hop from one flagstone to the next. alternating a hop on his right foot, feet together, and then a hop on his left foot.\n\n• #first# might jump over a swaying rope, using a stepping action over the rope and then a hop on both feet before the next stepping over.\n\n• #first# might run for a few steps and then hop with both feet at the end.

It may be easy for #first# to hop and to step, but putting them together in the class skip requires more thought and coordination.  There are games such as hop scotch where the player need only step and hop on the preferred leg, such as a step-right, hop-right, hop-right.  It is the total rhythm:  step-right, hop-right, step -left, hop-left. that is the hard part.  Children often leave out the hop-left and just make their skip a right sided skip.   Find games and situations where the simpler step right, hop right, hop right makes sense and can be felt as a success.  Sometimes switch to a step-left, hop-left, hop-left.

How does he create a loop in the right span that can fit under the wrap that he just completed at the base of the loop he is holding high in his left hand.  He needs another hand.  He gently releases his left hand grip in order to pull a new loop through the wrap.  He is keenly aware that the left strand loop is in jepordary, but he can think of nothing else to do.  He keeps his body soberly still, makes the head of a loop in the right spand with his right hand and by opening a space in the wrap with his left hand, pulls the right span loop through.  At this point he knows he is close but to clinch the knot he must pull both loops in opposite directions at the same time!  Voila, he does it, stands up with pride, and promptly asks his father to tie his other shoe.','One can see that tying a shoe string has a number of serious challenges of sequence, finger position, and strategy.  As practiced shoe-tiers, we adults are not even aware of the many little tricks that we use to accomplish this complicated, but mundane task.  For example, many people use the thumb of their left hand to serve as a \"post\" around which the right span can be wrapped.  Thus, when the right span loop needs to be placed under the wrap, the thumb can be removed and leaves a nicely shaped gap for the right span loop. The complexity of this strategy should be clear.  The child has to use the thumb in two ways at once.  The thumb is used both as a post for the wrap but also as part of the pinching action to keep the left loop tall and in tact.  No wonder velcro laces have become so popular.  And there is no need to make shoe tying a rite of passage into maturity.  This complicated skill will come in time, with your support and affirmation of the parts of this task which *1 learns along the way','Such refined skills of the hands and fingers will occur in other situations where the problem is as much how to think about the task as it is making the fingers make delicate movements.\n• Buttons - knowing to open the button hole by pushing down on the side facing the button and up on the opposite side\n• Zippers - knowing to pull against the direction of the pull with one hand while pulling the zipper tab with the other hand \n• Folding a towel - knowing to place the whole towel flat before bending the towel over in the middle.\n','So many self-help tasks require a coordinated use of the fingers, gapping a button hole open before inserting the button, creasing the paper with the thumb so the other fingers can align the edges.  These subtle finger movements are more than making the muscles do what they should.  The movements also represent #first#\'s growing understanding of the materials and surfaces on which #he/she# works.  Paper slids very easily over polished wood so the fingers have to work in a different way than when that same attempt to fold paper takes place on a firm stretch of carpet.  Be alert to these differences and think about which surfaces present more of a challenge and which presents less.  And also think about what materials give #first# an advantage because they are more forgiving.  For example, tin foil is certainly easy to fold but it does not stay flat and it slides too much.  There is no need to frustrate #first# with difficult materials and surfaces when #he/she# is just learning a new task for #his/her# fingers. ','Knots without Pressure',NULL,'Sometimes it is fun to tie knots in string, supple rope or large shoe laces.  When there is no one waiting on #first# to tie #his/her# shoes so all the family can go out the door, #first# can relax and experiment with making loops in string that either tie a knot or do not knot.   Give #first# a long shoe lace that is nailed to a two by four in the middle of the lace.  The board will anchor the lace sufficiently to let #first# experiment with different kinds of knots.','Have another lace nailed to the opposite end of the two by four so you can model a few knots for #first#.   Begin by tying just an ordinary cross hatch knot, on strand over and under the other.  Use the board itself as the thing that is bound by the knot.  That is, turn the board over so the side where the lace is nailed is on the bottom.  Then when the knot is tied, the two strands of the lace will close tightly on the board itself.  Then tie a bow tie knot and invited #first# to do the same. ','If you already know that #first# is not ready to attempt the bow tie knot, then just practice making the cross hatch knot, one strand over and under the other.  Find a small replica object such as a plastic action figure or small doll.  Tie the toy to the board with your lace using a cross hatched tie and invite #first# to do the same.  Motivate the game by making up some story about why you must lash the toy to the board, e.g. saving it in a ship wreck.  Notice where #first# is having trouble and then model the correct way, but this time make explicit comments about what your hands are doing, particularly at those points where #first# is having trouble.  For example, you might find you need to say, \"... and then I pull both ends in opposite directions at the same time.\"   When #first# gets to the trouble spot again, put into words what #he/she# is doing correct.  Do not put into words those acts that are incorrect.  Avoid words like \"good\"  or other non-specific praise.  Simply help #first# put #his/her# correct actions into words so that #he/she# can bring #his/her# actions under conscious control.  If #first# is not enjoying this game, stop immediately.','Try other knots with #first# if #he/she# is interested.   Try the bow knot, the slip knot, or the square knot.  Perhaps #first# would even like to invent a knot and give it a name.  Perhaps the two of you could invent a knot that was really easy to untie.  Or play a game where the knot is not pulled tightly.  Ask #first# if the lace will pull out straight or if the tightened lace will make a knot.  Try to trick each other my making loops that do not circle back through itself and thereby just pull out straight.','Tying knots requires a certain time of thinking about closed and open loops.  The child\'s ability to predict whether an arrangements of lace will knot or not requires a spatial thinking that deals with topological relations.  Topology is the study of open boundaries and closed boundaries and their relation to each other.  A knot is, topologically speaking, a path that loops over itself such that closing the loop entraps a segment of the lace.  While you should not expect #first# to put these principles into words at this age, you might still find that #he/she# has an ability to predict which loops will make knots and which ones will not.','Crazy Brushes',NULL,'Brushes drip, something that is not a problem with pencils.

The glass jar is better for many reasons.  One, because it is glass both you and #first# will take the process more seriously.  Because it is glass it will have a better weight and will not move with the pressure of the brush.  Because it is glass the lip provides a thicker surface for pressing excess paint from the brush.

Sometimes these marks represent movement in rather literal ways, such as slamming the brush into the paper to represent the impact of a tomatoe on the sidewalk.  Later the marks that represent movement are themselves made by painting movements that are not the same as the movement represented in the marks.

For instance, “The Eensy Weensy Spider” involves moving one’s fingers like a spider and making the rain come down with one’s fingers.  “Open, Shut Them” involves opening and closing ones hands.  “I’m a Little Teapot” involves moving one’s whole body like a teapot and tipping to the side to pour out the water.  When do children begin to reveal the ability to match movements to songs?  According to Moog (1976), children begin to match the appropriate movements to action songs at around one year of age. It appears that the amount of experience that children have with a song influences how they respond to it (Dowling, 1982).  However, Sloboda (1985) points out that even if children respond to the action pieces of certain songs, this does not imply that they necessarily know the tune.  They may be responding to word, texture, timbre, or some other characteristic.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:13','2012-08-22 12:30:13'),(2783,'m_12_2','Repeating Figures in Musical Babble ','By around one year of age, children’s musical babbling reveals noticeably increased complexity. Musical babbling generally occurs in response to music that the child hears, but does not resemble the music that they are hearing.  Musical babbling, sometimes called “babbling songs” are sounds of varied pitch produced either on one vowel or on a few syllables (Hargreaves, 1986). Children at this age tend to include repeated figures (Moog, 1976).  Hargreaves (1986) noted a four-note figure which varied in repetition in his own child’s song at this age. \n\nThrough their babbling, infants explore the elements of music (Ostwald, 1973).  For example, while musically babbling infants may experiment with musical elements like pitch, rhythm, tempo and volume (Holahan, 1987). By one year of age, children use these musical elements to serendipitously construct rudimentary melodies (Ostwald, 1973). While children may play with various musical elements in their musical babbling, children typically do not intentionally manipulate these elements in their early song creations, rather they are the product of experimentation.  Children\'s earliest songs generally lack conventional tonality and rhythmic organization.  Musical learning and development in children tends to progress through various stages, typically beginning with developments in the ability to reproduce a melody\'s lyrics, then it’s rhythm, then it’s contour or the emotional tone, and finally the ability to maintain the appropriate keys.\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:13','2012-08-22 12:30:13'),(2784,'m_15_1','Singing “Sliding” Pitch Songs','Before about 18 months of age (between 12 and 18 months), children’s songs are characterized by sliding, non-discrete pitch. They often slide from pitch to pitch within a single breath using continuous as opposed to discrete pitches.  Their melodies are undulating, continuous blends of pitches. (Davidson, McKernon, & Gardner, 1981; McKernon, 1979).  This is referred to as “pitch glissandi.”  Glissando refers to the rapid sliding up and down of the musical scale.  Pitch refers to the musical key in which something is set, the highness or lowness of sounds, or one could say the frequency.  \n\nBetween these ages children are experimenting with the sounds and pitches which they can produce. Typically at this age when children sing they use a continuous voice, making a glissando or blend of pitches (Davidson et al., 1981). While children’s songs are developmentally characterized by sliding pitch at this age, Hargreaves (1986) argues that they are able to produce discrete pitches and do recognize discrete pitches. By around 19 months, children begin to sing in discrete pitches, and are developing two important elements of singing, rhythm patterning and organization of melody (Davidson et al., 1981)\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:13','2012-08-22 12:30:13'),(2785,'m_18_1','“Dancing” to Rhythm ','As children get older, they increasingly attempt to match their rhythmic movements to the music that they hear. While they typically begin to attend to rhythm and engage in “dancing” around 9-12 months, the kinds of movements that they engage in when responding to movement increases dramatically (Hargreaves, 1986) around this time. According to Hargreaves (1986), characteristic movements include nodding their heads, seesawing on one foot, raising and lowering their heels, and moving their knees back and forth.. Moog (1976) found that children made circular or large turning movements and that they waved their arms in response to the music as if conducting.  Coordinating music and movement is still a challenge and while children do attempt to match their movements to those in the music and will try to “dance” with others, they can’t do it for very long.  Moog (1976) found that children 18-24 months could match their movements to the rhythm of the music for short periods of time.  The length of time increased with age, but children reach a plateau between the third and fourth years.  The length of time for which children can sustain such efforts improves with age, though not markedly in the next couple of years (Moog, 1976).\n\nBy around two years of age, a small percentage (about 10%) of children can match their movements to music.  Up to age five, there does not appear to be any big changes in how children move to music except for the following two trends, according to Sloboda (1985): the variety of movements children engage in increases and yet at the same time, children become less spontaneous and the number of movements decreases dramatically.\n\nAround the end of the first year, babies begin to respond to the rhythmic aspects of music by bouncing, swaying and “dancing” (Hargreaves, 1986).  In testing 500 children from age 6 months to 5 years, Moog (1976) found that while nearly all babies made some movements in response to different types of music (such as swaying side to side or bouncing up and down), between the ages of 9 months to one year these behaviors increased in frequency, intensity, and duration. \n\nSome researchers suggest that rhythmic imitations appear before similar imitations of pitch and contour (Moog, 1976) while others have differed (Bentley, 1966; Revesz, 1953 as cited by Shuter-Dyson & Gabriel, 1981) as pointed out by Shuter-Dyson and Gabriel (1981).

Instead of blending pitches as in the past, they produce discrete pitches (McKernon, 1979).  While younger children (12-18 months) often sing in continuous as opposed to discrete pitches with undulating melodies and continuous blends of pitches (Davidson, McKernon, & Gardner, 1981; McKernon, 1979), by 19 months of age the character of children’s songs shifts and is typified by discrete pitch.

They recorded spontaneous musical behavior and also attempted to teach the children some simple songs.\n\nIntervals refer to the difference in pitch between tones.

These are the intervals that are most commonly heard in songs within our culture.  Intervals refer to the difference in pitch between tones.  They are pairs of tones that are either melodic (consisting of two successive tones) or harmonic (consisting of two simultaneous tones).  Researchers (Werner, 1961) used to believe that minor thirds were children’s first interval, but later research suggests that it is accompanied by smaller intervals (McKernon, 1979).

By around 28 months, children are more likely to demonstrate the correct rhythmic organization.

Prior to this time, children experiment with vocalizations, sounds, pitch and contour as they acquire greater musical ability.  After this time, they begin to create songs and sing spontaneously during play (Miller, 1986). Typically around 3 years of age, children begin to spontaneously imitate songs they have heard, first imitating the words, followed by the rhythm and pitch (Nye, 1983; as cited in Miller, 1986).

These early attempts to reproduce song fragments reflect the beginnings of children\'s transition from spontaneous song to learned songs. \n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:13','2012-08-22 12:30:13'),(2795,'m_33_1','Singing Potpourri Songs','As children’s songs progress towards culturally valued “correct” forms, they tend to draw aspects and fragments of standard songs into their spontaneous songs (Davidson et al., 1981; Moog, 1976).  New songs are made up of melodies, rhythms and words that are already a part of children’s repertoire.  Moog (1976) called these “potpourri songs” in an attempt to capture their eclectic character.  Children begin to blend pieces of learned songs and to substitute different pitches.  These songs become increasingly sophisticated with increasing age.  Children may incorporate verbal, social word play into them as in examples provided by Hargreaves (1986). [See related Learning Window, Playing Socially with Words.]  However, McKernon (1979) notes that standard songs tend to be more sophisticated and Winner (1982) notes that it is harder for children to repeat their spontaneous songs to others and that it is easier to memorize and share standard songs given their tonal organization.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:13','2012-08-22 12:30:13'),(2796,'m_33_2','Beginning to Notice Harmony','Harmony appears to be one of the most difficult musical concepts for children to understand; research indicates that harmonic discrimination develops later than the ability to discriminate timbre or pitch (Costa-Giomi, 1994).

Kastner & Crowder (1990) conducted a study which indicated that children as young as 36 months were able to associate positive emotions, or a feeling of \"happiness\" (via selecting a picture of a happy face) when listening to major harmonies; they similarly were able to associate negative emotions, or a feeling of \"sadness\", with minor harmonies.  By around 42 months of age, children\'s spontaneous songs begin to reveal early instances of harmonic organization.

Research suggests that by around three years of age, children are just beginning to be able to clap or tap in a steady pattern for a very brief period.  Research by Williams, Sievers, and Hattwick (1933) found that 25% of three years olds could tap in time to half second clicks on a rhythm machine.  By 5 years of age, 75% of youngsters succeeded and by 6 years of age, 94% of youngsters succeeded.  Other research suggests that it depends in part what children are trying to duplicate.  When duplicating speech rhythms or tapping a regular rhythm, three years olds fared better than when clapping rhythms (Rainbow, 1977; Rainbow & Owen, 1979). According to Moorehead and Pond (1978), children’s earliest spontaneously generated patterns tend to be regular, unaccented and monotonous. Over time irregular accents begin to show up. According to Davidson and Colley (1987) the periods of time between ages three to four and seven to nine are periods of rapid growth in rhythm and coordination.\n\nBy the time children are four and five, they are beginning to be able to duplicate short rhythmic patterns.  Research by Zenatti (1976 as cited in Hargreaves, 1986) shows that children show marked improvement around 4.8 years of age.  She asked 4 and 5 year olds to duplicate rhythms containing two, three, or four notes in two trials.  Prior to 4.8 years of age, children tended to be more successful on their second trial than their first, but by 4.9 years of age, 70% of the children’s first attempts were successful.  Prior to 4.8 years of age, children did best when the melodies were played on a piano.  Between 4.9 and 5.2 years of age, there was no difference between the piano and non-melodic taps.  After 5.2 years of age, children did better with the non-melodic taps. Stambak (1960 as cited in Hargreaves, 1986) found that the numbers of errors children made decreased between 6 and 12 years of age.  Most six year olds could reproduce 3 to 4 taps correctly.  They made on average nine errors in 21 trials.  Eight year olds made 5.5 errors in 21 trials and could reproduce 5 taps and twelve year olds made three errors in 21 trials and could reproduce 7-8 taps.

Referential meaning refers to the idea that music can refer to nonmusical events or concepts (Cooke, 1959; Langer, 1957).  The opposite position is “absolutist” –the idea that music can refer to nothing outside of itself (Hanslick, 1885/1957).  Trainor and Trehub (1992) ran three experiments in which they asked subjects ranging from 3.0 to 6.3 years old to match excerpts from Prokofiev’s Peter and the Wolf and other musical selections to different animals.  Even the youngest children were able to assign extramusical meaning and the pattern of their errors paralleled those of older children and adults. A few children offered explanations for their choices and referred to certain music as “scary” and thus fitting with the wolf or the music “sounds just like a bird” and thus matches the bird.  Certain contrasts revealed stronger performance, for instance, wolf-bird, as opposed to bird-duck, cat-duck, or wolf-cat. The authors speculate that certain musical characteristics confer special meaning.  For instance, the low pitch, high intensity, and full chords characteristic of the “wolf: music and the rapid tempo, instrumentation, and large pitch range of the “bird” music.  Further support that children can assign referential meaning comes from Gardner (1973).  He asked children as young as three and a half to select antonyms (happy/sad) to match stimuli from other modalities on which they performed reasonably well.

They tend to engage in concentrated, still listening instead of moving around. From about 9-18 months of age, children spontaneously move around to music.  In testing 500 children from age 6 months to 5 years, Moog (1976) found that nearly all babies made some movements in response to different types of music (such as swaying side to side or bouncing up and down).  Up to age five, there does not appear to be any big changes in how children move to music except for the following two trends, according to Sloboda (1985).  The variety of movements children engage in increases and yet at the same time, children become less spontaneous and the number of movements decreases dramatically. According to Sloboda (1985), in order to get five year olds to move, one must ask them to.  According to Hargreaves, (1986), while the amount of movement that they engage in decreases, the variety of the types of music increases. Their coordination also increases and their dance steps become increasingly differentiated and recognizable.

She found that children as young as 48 months showed a preference for consonant chords over dissonant chords, an indication that children were not only able to discriminate between the two, but they could place some sort of organized, evaluative measure to what they were hearing.  This harmonic organization later evolves to a more discriminatory ability [see related window, Distinguishing Between Consonance and Dissonance in Isolation at 9 years].

Children’s phrases tend to begin on higher notes and move down towards and end on a low note.\n\nCreating songs with phrases is one example of how young children gradually acquire the rules of tonality and song construction that are prevalent in their culture; researchers such as Zenatti (1983, as cited in Hargreaves, 1986) have stressed the role of acculturation in the musical products of early childhood.

Children attempt to avoid error and aim for precision (Gardner & Wolf, 1983).  Moog (1976) found that parents often reported children wanting to hear the same songs over and over again for weeks and months on end.

In fact, it is not until about the age of 5-6 years that children can begin to actually sing short melodies on key.  Research investigating this fact finds that children first learn the general “shape” or contour of a melody rather than actual notes or pitch intervals (McKernon, 1979). \n\nAbility to maintain a tonality, or stay \"in tune\", appears to be necessary to singing on key.  One study indicated that children at the age of about 36 months were more likely to shift tonal centers (change keys) when singing than 48-month-olds were (Flowers & Dunne-Sousa, 1990).  Additionally, these researchers found that the ability to maintain a consistent key did not seem to coincide with a child\'s ability to \"echo\" or repeat a pitch pattern presented to him or her.  Another study conducted a longitudinal analysis of children, maintaining that, in some instances, first graders were able to sing on key.  They concluded that this was in part a function of musical training and education that the children received (Wassum, 1980; as cited in Flowers and Dunne-Sousa, 1990).\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:13','2012-08-22 12:30:13'),(2806,'m_48_4','Forming Concepts of Instrumental Timbre','As children increase with age, they are exposed to a variety of musical experiences that can effect their musical abilities, including instrumental timbre association (Wooderson & Small, 1981).   Children as early as 42 months of age (the preschool years for American children) exhibit abilities to differentiate among the sounds of various musical instruments.  Jetter (1978) found that of the three instruments he used when testing children\'s identification of timbre, the accuracy in identification was greatest for the clarinet, followed by the trombone and cello.  He added that \"out-of-school\" music experiences were important variables to investigate when measuring a child\'s ability to discriminate instrumental timbre. \n\nEducators have subsequently developed various teaching strategies for instrumental timbre discrimination.  Fullard (1967) suggests that a preschooler\'s ability to comprehend, generalize, and discriminate various instrumental timbres is fostered by the method of presentation or instruction.  In his research, Fullard (1967) examined children from 42-59 months of age. The first part of his \"lesson\" included presenting the children with a set of three pictures of instruments, teaching them the names of each.  Once this was accomplished, he presented a recording of each instrument, again informing the children which recording corresponded with which instrument.  He then randomly selected a recording previously presented and asked the children to identify the instrument.  The children in his group were able to do so, after time, with proper scaffolding; in addition, when he later presented a second set of three pictures of different instruments and repeated the process, the children were much more successful and completed the task using less time than before.\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:13','2012-08-22 12:30:13'),(2807,'m_54_1','Learning to Remember the Words and the Tune of a Song Together','Research suggests that children increasingly learn to remember the words of a song and the tune of a song as integrated components as they grow older.  According to Davidson, McKernon and Gardner (1981), children begin to use put words to tunes by two to three years of age.  By four to five years of age, the tune and the lyrics begin to be recognizable to outside observers (McKernon, 1979).  By five to six years old, they can remember tunes and words to many familiar songs (Morrongiello and Roes, 1990).  According to Morrongiello and Roe (1990), it can be difficult for two year olds to hum a melody without using the words.  They tested five to six year olds and adults in two test sessions.  During the first one, they played three novel tunes each with rhyming text then in the second session played the same three tune with non-rhyming text.  After this, they went through a series of trials during which they heard one of five types of songs. The songs were: the same as the original song; a completely new song (words and tune); a mismatched song with the tune of one of the previous songs but the words of another; old words with a new tune; or new words with an old tune.  The subjects were asked if the each trial song was the same, somewhat the same, or not at all the same.  Adults and children chose a higher proportion of songs as the same, suggesting that typically we recall the words of a song with its tune.  However, the percentage was significantly greater for the adults than for the five to six year olds.  The words more often than the tune turned out to be the most important feature for children.  Whether the tune rhymed or not did not appear to have any affect at either age.  (The test here looked at recognition of the song, however, not whether individual lines could be recalled.)

They also organized the rhythm of the song locally rather than in terms of the underlying beat or pulse of the song.  They appeared to recall the rhythm from the words themselves. Five year olds, on the other hand, maintained the key throughout beginning and ending on the same tonic. They organized the song in terms of the overall beat or pulse of the song. This is not to say that five year olds reproduced all the notes exactly, but they did so with significantly greater precision than four year olds.  \n\nSloboda (1985) suggests that this increased precision is accompanied by a ceasing of musical exploration unless people are given explicit opportunities to engage in it.\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 12:30:14','2012-08-22 12:30:14'),(2809,'m_60_1','Learning the Quantitative Aspects of Songs','Around five years old, children begin to master the quantitative aspects of song in that the pitch values, intervals, lengths of notes and so on begin to become recognizable (Davidson, McKernon, & Gardner, 1981).  Researchers at Harvard Project Zero have referred to this as digitally as opposed to topologically mapping a song. By five years of age, many children have learned quite a number of the nursery and preschool songs of their culture.  Research summarized by Hargreaves (1986) suggests that when learning a song, children first learn the words, then the rhythm, then contour, and then intervals (Updegraff, Heileger, & Learned, 1938; Moog, 1976; Petzold, 1966).  Davidson et al. (1981) studied how four and five year olds fill in the outlines of a song.  They found that children’s first grasp is topological.  This means that there is an emphasis on the outline of the song–its global properties.  Even so, some aspects of contour, rhythm, and pitch are present.  Next, they start to learn its rhythmic properties, the underlying pulse of the song.  During the third and fourth phases, children are mastering the key stability of the song–an advance that occurs during the fifth year.  At the third phase, children are mastering the pitch contours and in the fourth phase they are achieving key stability.  Right around five years old, children grow able to organize phrases into a common stable key.

(1988) found that children (age range of 5-6) could distinguish between two versions of the same song in a two different keys.  In addition, children were able to recognize musical transformations, in familiar songs, which preserved the original rhythm and contour yet changed the intervals.  Consequently, Pick et al. concluded that children were able to detect a key transposition change, even in familiar melodies.  Key changes were more readily identified when the new key resulting from the key change was more distant from the original key on the Western tonal scale.  Imberty (1969; as cited in Hargreaves, 1986) found that seven year olds could detect key changes in the middle of familiar tunes with great reliability. \n\nThe property of key or scale has received attention in research investigating melody perception in adults and children (Pick et al., 1988).  One study found that, for both adults and children, the opinion of whether or not a musical six-note passage was \"melodious\" depended upon whether or not the last two notes were in the same key as the preceding four notes (Krumhansl & Keil, 1982). \n\nBartlett and Dowling (1980) played Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star to different ages.  One was played in the key of C and the others were transformed–either the pitch was transposed keeping the contours and the intervals or the tones were imitated and contour kept the same but the interval sizes were changed. Five year olds were not able to tell the differences between the various transformations.  However, this contradicts the Pick et al. (1988) findings that that children (age range of 5-6) could distinguish between two versions of the same song in a two different keys. Children were able to recognize musical transformations, in familiar songs, which preserved the original rhythm and contour yet changed the intervals.  Consequently, Pick et al.

Most subjects consistently preferred consonant excerpts to dissonant excerpts by age seven.  By examining the responses of those children who made consistent judgments earlier, she found that for some children a preference for consonant chords emerged earlier than for musical passages–around age five.  Other research supports a general increase in a preference for more consonant music between ages five to eleven (Bridges as cited in Hargreaves, 1986, 1965; Imberty, 1969 as cited in Hargreaves, 1986; Shuter-Dyson & Gabriel, 1981: Sloboda, 1985).
